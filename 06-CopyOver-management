Copy Over Instances of Duplicate Code
I know i wrote some twice over
Mostly because of legacy and final versions.
That there will be likely a legacy/final/ai/dev version of a test-chamber containing a launch relay. (Which is good to have anyway so we will call it the copyover) and make it a management for all copyovers that occur (so it doesn't have to overcopy)
