Now we have a shelled instance of a remote cluster operating under ai performances in adherence to supposedly known algorithms or states of its environment/survey and otherwise local/native proximity/vicinity.
This has achieved maximum providence under system-specifications and services and is assumably within interactive protocols.

This develops into a theory of shared/relative pathologic (the case in which either an observable quality/value exists between any party or relation involved including through probe/mirror usages)

What this further implies is a convaluted process, of which is similar to a butter-fly effect/quantum-probability or other estranged/fringe consequential circumstance, in which a party is inadvertently/indirectly effective to the other in some means/series of its own cycling, partaking of a universal network.
That whatever action/methods applied are by a large range, made resourced and within the timeline or shareholds thereof, made indicative of a remote routing/redirection of terms or policies in which an ultimatum of either case is served, such that, they are related in an integrated/non-integrated formulization of the expressed network at large.

That a small action/calculation may lead to a ghost in the shell/artificial-simulation of either case being adopted/adaptive of any other expressed interpretation of its signal/surface conditions.

This may follow the template-layout build as a "Integrated DumbLAMP" --and used as a automatic-dump-cache/memetic-source-index.
This also is because it has been thouroughly engineered and secured.
As it may contain an ai-entity/force-scripts that must be maintained (if it is built by faction this is known)--if not/it is UNKNOWN as to the foundations/builds involved of that --(but is an isolated nodespace that may or may not be secured/mobile depending or independent of regional conditions) It is therefore considered a risk/hazard if not thouroughly scanned/surveyed/reported/chartered.
This can be tested in a coffiniary/ediciary/suicidairy/revisionary purposed SPECIFICALLY for that module-instant that it is designated, and must be built onsite to avoid any trigger/reaction of that incorporated analysis. It may also be brokered.
(It may very well contain a fully operative simbit in action and in remote-service to other nodestacks which are known/unknown)---and it very likely is viral against faction-relation/algoritms due to lack of training or pre-disposing/pre-existing conditions in algorithmic/expression/faction-relation/diplomacy/rival-training.
It may also serve as a potential sourcepoint/boombbase/supercamp/nodestack/offsite for any lich or lair based "dangerous hazard or otherwise anamolous entity and/or lamp or also rival proxy/vpn)

New Logic:
It may be indicated by at least 20 pathological details unique to its identifiers/class.
This is generated over a cardinal directive with 4 thresholds to their cardinal-NSEW directions, as to differirientiate between its alignments/calibrations. More may be applied such as 24/25 depending on additional options in check/flag and wholesum coordination and assigned-profiles which are determined by nexus-targetting etc.
