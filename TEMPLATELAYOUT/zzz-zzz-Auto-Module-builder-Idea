Nearing the End of my want to update this stuff (I had opendevin working for me then it broke in an update, now I dont want to do anything unless it works again)--pretty annoying because I havent gotten it to work despite looking around 500 web pages on what to even do. (What the fuck ever man.)

I don't know how to code at all.
Something maybe for tailwind or whisper idk or care really.
