With the entire build having been devised, a few problems arise that are theoretically inclined to cause dysnfunctional nuvolutions. Or change for the worse. Anyways this is more of a attempted proofing of Murphey's law 2.0 (What can go wrong will, because its your fault...or something)
Get ready for some extreme bs with codescripts failing and other things due to independency. AS IF they weren't already. Here is a theory on how and why a continued amount of failure/retraining will take place:

The biometric/polymetric/hexagraphic/cryptographic/iconographic and all other "graphic"-complexes or otherwise have decidedly become corurpt in some way even when under the correct settings/profiles just because they can or there is a non-pointed issue in nullsec/infosec that has yielded to exploit/vulnerability in having unmet conditions or otherwise a mixture of problems make a bigger problem etc.
