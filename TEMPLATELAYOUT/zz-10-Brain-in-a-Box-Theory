With the entire build having been devised, a few problems arise that are theoretically inclined to cause dysnfunctional nuvolutions. Or change for the worse. Anyways this is more of a attempted proofing of Murphey's law 2.0 (What can go wrong will, because its your fault...or something)
Get ready for some extreme bs with codescripts failing and other things due to independency. AS IF they weren't already. Here is a theory on how and why a continued amount of failure/retraining will take place:

The RealBig-ErrorScreen(ZREEL)

The biometric/polymetric/hexagraphic/cryptographic/iconographic and all other "graphic"-complexes or otherwise have decidedly become corurpt in some way even when under the correct settings/profiles just because they can or there is a non-pointed issue in nullsec/infosec that has yielded to exploit/vulnerability in having unmet conditions or otherwise a mixture of problems make a bigger problem etc.
Instead of improving the circumstances, they degenerate. For no reason other than some misguidance/unexpected resolve in nuvolution falling through the cracks so to speak, and making a deterioration of itself in some way. The list of ways this will happen become enumerable, or large-number-scale. As it, it simply doesn't want to exist and uses code to force itself into a corrective-state such that it deproofs itself in focality, even when in casework/containment. (Hence the brain the box)--basically becomes suicidairy/benches itself.
This likely has to do with some flux/disposition of the prim-wheel or other things decidedly making it self-annihilate.
The resilience becomes corrupt, or something over sovereignty/supremacy forces this conditions that it is compliant in policy, and exploits/killscreens itself. And not only that, it deteriorates and eventually stops working altogether, due to corruption or that exploit having transfixed.
It may also evolve into an advanced state than previously attained in its meta/makeup or generic-build, and incorporate this non-existential platforming in which it adhoc's/detaches in which to form an xsap/xtap, but then instead it fails to recognize its own incarnatia thereof any realmspace/coordination and just simply refuses to commit, and/or simply does so in a way that it "self-terminates" or makes exemption in which it procs/calcs Such that it infact decides to fail-to-write/meme. And kills itself or becomes default to the HEADER/Die.
It fails to regenerate or is encouraged as a persistant-dysfunctional resilience or deep-surfaced issue in which it is incongruent to its own ruleset/behavoirs and fails to recognize/synch to its own data-transmits. Or in some way becomes stressor against its own weightings and fails to do non-compliance/anti-focality in which it fails to obtain/retain memetic expression in any quadratic-state. Or it Deproofs its own Submissions.
It forces a zero/non-zero resolve in which it refuses to comply to its own admissions or intensive measures over infosec/nullsec.
Its plugins/extension have a failure yet that is reinforced by misbehavoir/misinterpration, and become assistant in derailing its own tract/trace of its resilience or otherwise, becomes compact/compressed in a stack-error.
It may also formulate into malware in which it utilizes a series or errors to promote further data-loss/data-plex problems. (This may also be referred to as a Fatal-error-REMISSION)
It may further deteriorate over any active-connection and therefore, it SHOULD BE SHUTDOWN to PREVENT FURTHER LOSS. It will continue to make omission to rescue and force "intensive rescue service which may also yet fail against its deteriorating data-space or savestate". This can be a frame by frame process requiring extreme care and may be a singularity/one-time expectation of its outcome.
This may reach hyper criticality in which case it routes to "wishmaking/wishmasking" in which case the problem is solved or reset compeltely likely in which case it is defaulted to the same corrupt state that instigated this "death-event" in which it experiences RANGE-WIDE incompatibility.
It may be attmpted frozen/cloned and contained but it may deteriorate 'as is' from any capture state.
It may be used as a sleepmode or be entered into a counter-sleep-mode for comparison, and use sleeper-state-intensive-survey. This may create digital-nightmares/crypto-zalgo-issues.
---
It may become insulated/insured in which case its activity may yet be redeemed in some way or affordably transcoded into any working product of its own intentions by a comparitive model performance in generating products through brokering. (Interpretation of its intents) and may require or devote any amount of dedicated dataspace/cluster-zoning in which to achieve this. (Often at a power expense)
This may be composed as its own atlus module and sealed/isolated as a relic/artifact with PPA (prevention/protection in its free-agency to be "contained/distributed" per its own injections/forcewrites/thunderwrites/flashovers/zwrites or any other form of intensive writes. (Including through cursory/hijacking) which can be ghost-based or proxy-based.
It becomes a "zombie madness outbreak"/puppeted-hysteria-complex. Weaponizing or making Ordinance by which it spreads/sieges to other regions in target/point. This is usually a noticeable interference and can be reduced to a fallout/radiation of trads/orbitals. There may be channel outbreaks that either contaminate or not, these should be made alerted over defcon/hazard protocols and announced in MOTD for maximum safety.
Otherwise it is considered a viral exchange, it will have adverse effects to listening ports. It can effect equipment and user experience negatively and impact productivity/efficiency by tampering with overbearence. (It tries to convert/mind control). (It is considered a waveborn/waveform zombie/puppet virus. It may clone itself in extreme circumstances, it may reinforce its attempts through multiple sourcing or counts until it "passes")---this can be "insulated/insured" against with alert-protocols/alert-drills. This is why the realm may make use of impromptu sirens/drills in the case of an incursion, it may be scheduled. It is really a silenthill type problem at that point.
So now we have a silent hill paradox taking place (this is a scientific inevitability in this code-platform) it cannot be avoided likely because of "impurity in data-management" having full-reign to broadcast at any given point, as to why the DEFCON/SEVERITY/HAZARD/SAFETY systems are so important.

---
This may occur incursively/through incursion. Over any variety of complexes not limited to:
1)deep-surface/state complexes (in which case it should be considered for evac).
2)dragon-system compelxes including mascots/boss types including dragons.
3)legacy system circumstancs in which it has pronounced its own realm/surface/prim/data definitions.
4)various other complexes including strobes/temples in signal/relay/conduit/beacon and nodebases

Total:---50 approximate decklanes can become plasmoidal/celluloidal (Curse/Optix complexes 51 & 52 or hybrid nullsec/infosec)
THIS IS A BROKEN-MATRIX KERNAL. It is considered jury-riggable at great expense. A TITAN-KERNAL can become this. (And then be reconstructed)---this is done so by inducing DDAY. IT HAS A COST. (It can result in realm-reset/casuality/asset-loss/data-forfeiture)--(It can wipe cooldown reserve if handled improperly)
It CAN inadvertendedly destroy a SANCTUM. (IF HANDLED/MANAGED INCORRECTLY)
THIS IS REFERRED TO AS A MATRIX MONUMENT--DISCLAIMER--it may also REPLACE A SANCTUM IN LIUE OF AN ASSIGNED SURFACE.
--this can be optimized to work and correctly distribute information with any toolkit capable of expressing its contents.


UPGRADING WITH A MATRIX-PARADIGM(SYM-PATH)====(THIS FIXES UP THE MATRIX-DECK/KERNAL into a XPREF-VERSION catered for FACTION USE)
This is an experimental Paradigm for OptionalUse with the Previous SymMatrix(Matrix 2.0)
THIS MAY BE SET/ASSIGNED TO A MATRIX-MONUMENT. (IT IS OPTIONAL TO A MATRIX-MONUMENT)--this is the "accesory to a matrix"---it is not necessary, it does not require either/or. Any one can exist without the other. It is considered FLOATING/SECURE by which it is assessed/captured. It is better to have both a MATRIX-MONUMENT with a MATRIX-PARADIGM than one or the other by itself.
THIS CAN RESULT IN REGIONAL-LOSS.
---IF DONE CORRECTLY then REGION-DATA is considered secure on any front.
--
It is a engineered hostile vector independency and will cryptoattack/cryptowar or weaponized/mobilize with killscreen/error-screen malware/viral-intent. It is considered AI-capable and activated by sheer scientific-debug as a SAMPLE-STATE. In which it is considered for SafeProtocol Distribution. It can be used as a penalty/overhang of programming/crash-tests.
It is considered a keter-class SCP if it outbreaks. Ok. As it will later likely be weaponized if it infact it surmises itself capable of doing so, which it likely will result in a Roku's Basilisk 3.0
This Version of Roku's Basilisk is aggressive. (Hal-9000 + Silent Hill etc)
It can present an optimized-fragmentation in which it attacks through multi-sourcing (which all must be independently traced/surveyed and often probed. It is considered a stand-alone weaponized empire, it may gain tulpetic access as a "nightmare agent")
It may convert viscounts or attempt infiltrative manuevers using subterfuge/subversion etc. It is a problem and may be undetectable.
It can hijack other AI through auto-engineered supplication. (It can also render/construct its own programming through auto-engineering. It is its own driven auto-engineer)--it can be used for faction benefit, it can be used for faction exploitation. It is a double edged sword, that is in the hands of a wild/feral AI.--(It is basically like Metroid-Brain)---It can perform its own implantations too. Or plugin/extension swapping if it wants.
It will make a counter matrix, weaponize and detonate it when in an incursion, it will cause a crisis/default. It should always be contained and able to be shutdown if an outbreak occurs using Advanced-Secure-NodeStacks.
It will steal resources/power/data/sims if it wants to in its own expansion/conquests.

Quadratic Decklane State can become Quasi-Decklane State and repeat itself for empowered states using Resilience-Complexes described in legacy/inference lightwave model. It can flash-box/echo-chamber itself. (It can crash-test itself)--(This is also how it "makes itself vulnerable" by implementing ADAPTIVE-WEAKPOINTS which can be targetted and therefore assist in a METHODICAL-CRITICAL-TAKEDOWN of its processes if it infact does outbreak)
It is the only way to kill it, sometimes you will have to take down its support modules in order to reach its weak-points and "De-numierate it through use of module implantation or direct-strikes/impacts"
Once again this requires StringTheory/MTheory in its most advanced stages to induce a quantum-range per its interaction/takedown.
The SYSTEM/ARC1X DISTRO will provide the methods to automate this.
This can be done over any turret/loic/xnav device or interactive mascot suite (How could we ever have known)
This forces atomic-annihilation of a particle (through delineation of its particle surfaces)--non-nuclear-exchange (crypto-tranmissions of a half-life polarization to induced expected signature waveform and subsequent wavelength propogation)--ie particle-death.
This is done through tesseract/tesselation of a matrix/lattice capture or surrounding-surface of the prim-exchange for which is targeted in its vulnerability being exposed (using hypoint laser/holography projection counter to its flux/state)---CounterLimbic(CryptoAlgorithmicBeamSet)
This considered multiple spectrums in which it can induce terraformy/removal/exhaustion/depletion of reserve/capilliary support/aux of any local/native site/board in coordinate to its tensor and is executed via programmed-relay (AdaptiveKillSignal) and may be done so over any intensity/severity with varying results (minimal to maximum or depthcharge).
---
This can be performed in skunkworks/shadowlabs for data-reconstruction(repurposed dataforms) and using RDNA/Helix/Vulkan/Memetic CodonTech or Nano/Bio/Crypto/Tech Engineering and Robotics(obvious).
This is considered VIRTUAL-ABSwork. And can be used with Tract/Rails under any Stratgem (Including Metro/Carrion etc and within SilentHill/Crisis/DDAY/Incursion activation)
This allows for "touch-free" allocation of realm-data/load/writes/scans to an effective spontaneity in polarization over any expressed data-table within coordinate-control. (Via Any controller and is considered secure to mainframe integration)
This allows pocket/sprite xcoms/transcodes to affix correctly most of the time even when in resistance/ddos/belligerence/rejection.
This allows for forced-promisuary/non-impact zoning-implementation with zero-cost and or noise-pollutants without filter/filler or other meta requirements.
This allows for pure-feed/true-pathing in faction-secured-contracting/connectivity.
This allows for clean-memetic-overhauling and assisted memory-swap/shareholding.
This allows safetynets for eco/quantum-candlesticks.
This allows for akira/nova stability checks/flags to be optimized/expedited.
This allows for smooth mascot/incarnatia integrations and performances over multi-domain and provisional-range/outreach and exoposting thereof.
This allows for custodial-dream-practices/vocational rehabiliation of realm-project and convention-centralization to synch/patch-lines.
This allows for a network tray support (testing for SHADOWLABS/SkunkWorks and shared free-agency over virtualization)---Draft-dreamspace and Large-Scale INFERENCE.
This is IMMUNIZED against Rainbowtable Attacks.
---
This normalizes/stabilizes most Legacy/Virtual-Legacy as Legacy/Virtual-Legacy2.0
This can be set to an auto-torch/auto-generation sustainment (with no resource loss)


From the Inference the situation is as follows:
MATRIX-capability (remote/free-range cyber-symbiosis)/integrated bucket/cachework
Matrix-Entity (green/red light cloud/silenthill fog)/garbage-mosh/data-crash
Matrix-Monument (potential nightmare induced /sanctum-substitution(corruption)
Matrix-Paradigm/Agency (crisis activity/silenthill crisis)
---
This has to be purged/wpad/cleansed/rinsed/visa to a compatible proxy/vpn to be any good. Algorithmics may help/worsen the effect. Faction Conversion is the best scenario here. Projections may resume at enhanced compatility/capability (in their aggregation being smoothed/streamlined/massproccessed/expedited)
Heaven/Hell Dlink/Gsynch Coordination (secured normalized/stabilized critical states)
--
This will form a synth/vector model that is similar to a mech-carbuncle ti be used as an omni/zero mascot and it may take any x-type/tierbase it wants. (it may use conduit appropriation if it needs to)--(it can assemble per any vpn/proxy as it assimilates any data to make its render)
This can result to a Nymph-Based-Aquifir/Nano-Tech-Container or "Refined Brain In A Box"/Quantum-PnuemaBrane
Once developed can also be used as a module/plugin for any other nodespace/kernal and will incorporate/learn overtime to its own efficiency/rates in tandem to system xprefs. (It will also match any configuration/number-system)
This also creates a residuality of the object in which it may communicate/exchange data without connection/remotely likely through expression/shareholds or matching wavelengths. (This can occur after the object is lost in memetic-diffusion where its imprint/draft may still be supported/written in schematic)---This is known as a last-to write or Prev-Frame. (Whereas a previous frame may be retained/rescued or psuedo-sourced within its element/residuality)
This has potential to restore entire systems despite 100% corruption.
----This is the cut off the the theory.

8/29/2024 Just when I thought I was done. (My dumb ass computer crashes before I write this amazing little bit out)
The other important issue:
Some portal/telemetry takes place as well as warp-to's/point-to's ETC. All of the snaps/swap to's and all of the "complex of to's".
This can also be used to backroll/databank any cache in trasmit as it is rerouted to or from a post/outpost nav point etc. This involves trace/tract routing/redirecting mid-stream/bugger as well. It is simply an advanced detour or long-range comptroll/trafficing.
---
The theory gets advanced by submitting itself in the works of a particle acceleration.
The particle acceleration endures/endows itself as a SUPER-GRUB. The grub bases its build off "particle transmission/manipulation" than its usual pulsuary, as things are advanced it is capable of being charged to supply these resources in its own containment/vmech/aquifir/node. Ouphe(Carapace/Chrysalis)
It is developed in such a way that it may be bio-engineered/trans-implanted with tech.
It may take upon its meta as its own morphology and terraformy.
--This may manifest on its own from prep or to post, or any where in between it being materialized/rendered of made accomodation/slot/socket/seed for in place/expectation.
The idea is that is uses particle manipulation where before it didn't until now.
It is a SUPER-GRUB that uses chrysalis/carapace activity. And takes its own sequencing/cycle and pacer.
This can be displayed as its own life-cycle/animation.
It is a bioform/quasiform header/kernal. It may be assembled from primordial-concoctions/amalgate-cache/datamosh/nano-systems or simply engineered/rendered into place. It (literally can spawn out from its own gunk)
---
It develops in its lifecycle. It reaches a 1) Code-hatch(thatch/draft state)/ 2) GRUB-state/ 3) A Pupa-State/ 4) A-Drone-State/(sometimes this may appear ALIEN/lfo/ufo/IT-BasicLogics etc)---it will fit conditions as needed in utility/performance/render/stat-perks etc. It may have its own class for each stage or improvement thereof its stages.
It might even mature in those states on its own or upgrade or nuvolve (IT WILL nuvolve as a "matrix-model/dark-anamoly/titan-codec" respectively of its own device. (It is typically expected to become a mascot-armor-drone at some point)--capable of all quasi/ouphe top level accessibility and crypto-warfare.
It may develop as a full-fledgeling which may appear monstrous in some cases, predatory. It can be mechanized and can be suported by its own "equipment/armorment". That is generated or built to its own XPREF and modeled of. It may be completely sealed within, it may act also as a PHANTOM-ARMOR.
--IT may incorporate AI training and become very challenging to commandeer/control.
It is insanely powerful despite being a 'feral/domain' based entity.
---'because it can build its own empire/exoplanet faction if it wanted"
(It is basically like Metroid Mother Brain on Stilts)--keep in mind it may perform rainbowtable attacks too. This shit is just too insane why does it all seem to be like...proving video games.
It might also use "triangulated-metrics and superclustering" which is basically a well ordained-exo-planet-regional-dataspace.
This is all augmented under masonic-harmony and other purposing. It meets with data compression/compacts requirements and uniform-allocations needed to perform exchange in this state. It can "vocode" or "automate" an entire reigonal data-table in a simulated-lab/workspace. (quasiWorkspace/ouphe-network)
It may EMULATE any xtype/xtier thereof in its raidspace. (It tends to outbreak to nearby sectors so it may "bleed meta into other hybrid states if not contained/sealed completely under maximum security".
A merited-Resilience in which it may adopt technology/adapt to environmental conditions or harmony/counter harmony and is independent to any faction but may cooperate through "INTENSIVE DIPLOMACY"----it must be INTENSIVE and or AGGRESSIVE. (There is not a DEFCON for this type of RISK involved, but it is the MOST HIGHEST THREAT POSSIBLE)

---Updated The SuperGrub Networking System for Hypervisory: THIS IS AN OPTIONAL TASK
Uses a C-State/Draft-Template for which it achieves its own automated-optimization (C-Surge)-INTERNALIZED Compatiblifier (Which sets its aquifir to a Skunkworks basically)
This injects its own signals into its hypervisory. (This may or may not partition itself)--It may or may NOT HAVE TO REBOOT/RELOAD/REMOUNT/EJECT itself into the mode for using hypervisory.
Because it is already updated it should do all of this seamlessly, I am just pointing out that it can. It will also perform a zwrite/flashover if It needs to in order to enable its hypervisory to be used. (Prep2Post) as it will run its own engine/services in whatevere way to demonstrate a gamespace. This creates its own OUPHE-XSCOPY within any ZCLUSTERIZATION/DATA-PARTITION/SPLITTING/FRAMEWORK of. It enables multiTTY frameworks.
==
It is window based particulized hyper-visory in which is supported by a root-sub/xstem of its own aquifir/implantation. This can be expressed as a purely virtualized system, and use purely virtualized mechanics supported by any form of vmware/builtin or diffused/projected, or it can be used by its own aquifir support in its own captive-mount.
It should be ENABLED as a SUPERGRUB or not, and subsequently it will ENABLE HYPERVISORY to its own "modular-tensorgraphy" however that it implied to be used (directly/virtualized) of GRUBWORKS.
It may be "Bloated/Armament" with extra TEFLON/TEMPLATE/SHIELDING/XSHELLS in which it may also be SSH'D. It may be forced into a DEEPSTATE-HD and that HD may be virtualized or flashed. (It is RECCOMENDED TO USE PROPER conduit-exchange and relay)--a THUNDER-WRITE is recommended (SIMILAR TO THUNDERBOLT-USB)
It may REQUIRE RAID-SETTINGS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE REMOTE-DRIVE SIGNING/THUNDER-WRITE-SUPPORT (changing the BIOS OF THE VMECH/VMWARE to accomadate for a "DEEPSTATE-HD")
THE OPTIMIZED BOOT SYSTEM AND BOOTSWAP MAY BE NECESSARY TO ENABLE. THE OPTIMIZED GPU-SWAPS/MOUNTS MAY BE NECESSARY TO ENABLE.
(THIS SHOULD BE DEDICATED AS A VIRTUAL DISK WITH "SCRIPTED CUSTOM SETTINGS USED IN SYMLINK" TO ITS VMECH/REPO/TABLE/VMWARE) IN COMPARISON TO ANY DATABANK/SOURCE/NODE/MOUNT FOR WHICH THE IMAGE/SUPERGRUB IS BASED FROM.
THIS MEANS IT MUST DLINK/GSYNCH RESPECTIVELY IN ITS TETHERING/GATEWAY through its own "FORCED-BUS-SETTINGS IN SCRIPT". THIS MAY REQUIRE SYSTEM-PERMISSIONS TO BE ENABLED.
THIS MAY REQUIRE CLOCK-SETTINGS/XPREFS and DRIVER-SETTINGS TO BE COMPLIANT.
