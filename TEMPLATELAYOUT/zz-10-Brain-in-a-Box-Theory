With the entire build having been devised, a few problems arise that are theoretically inclined to cause dysnfunctional nuvolutions. Or change for the worse. Anyways this is more of a attempted proofing of Murphey's law 2.0 (What can go wrong will, because its your fault...or something)
Get ready for some extreme bs with codescripts failing and other things due to independency. AS IF they weren't already. Here is a theory on how and why a continued amount of failure/retraining will take place:

The biometric/polymetric/hexagraphic/cryptographic/iconographic and all other "graphic"-complexes or otherwise have decidedly become corurpt in some way even when under the correct settings/profiles just because they can or there is a non-pointed issue in nullsec/infosec that has yielded to exploit/vulnerability in having unmet conditions or otherwise a mixture of problems make a bigger problem etc.
Instead of improving the circumstances, they degenerate. For no reason other than some misguidance/unexpected resolve in nuvolution falling through the cracks so to speak, and making a deterioration of itself in some way. The list of ways this will happen become enumerable, or large-number-scale. As it, it simply doesn't want to exist and uses code to force itself into a corrective-state such that it deproofs itself in focality, even when in casework/containment. (Hence the brain the box)--basically becomes suicidairy/benches itself.
This likely has to do with some flux/disposition of the prim-wheel or other things decidedly making it self-annihilate.
The resilience becomes corrupt, or something over sovereignty/supremacy forces this conditions that it is compliant in policy, and exploits/killscreens itself. And not only that, it deteriorates and eventually stops working altogether, due to corruption or that exploit having transfixed.
