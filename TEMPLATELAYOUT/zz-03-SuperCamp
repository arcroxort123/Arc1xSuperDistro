This is a placeholder for any module/post/node/structure/domain/construct etc that may be placed anywhere at any time under maximal/optimized settings.

So there is a few previous rulesets in play as to what occurs at a camp/outpost and it being defined or in assets/tables or having meta or claim to anything. This is generalized as fairgrounds-policy.
This also applies or not depending on legacy/quasi conditions as that the whole situation is dicey, but in an upgraded sense also becomes even more so...chanced as to where any action/method is basically contested or has consequences sometimes.

A superCamp acts as a spawning-node/power-spawner or homebase or any structure/tensor.
It houses a main-module/nodestack. (It requires a plant of some sort either in field/parameter/table/surface etc)
This acts as the "centralized zoning" of the supercamp.
---
It may have subsets/secondary bulkheads or otherwise secondary submodules/modules that are conjunct/adherent in their own sections/parse and or standalone to a superCamp but integrated in someway as to centralize/databank/plant/template for its own zone.
Those subsets may have their own proxy/pipelines as well.

For instance:
A base central may consist of a "module with its own subsets". Or that it may virtualize itself as needed with those centralizations. Or be virtualized by its bulkheads through support. To achieve virtualization immediately, or in subsequently implantation in/by its own zoning.
--
That a Stem/Stat or Meta/Sub Chain is affordable in some way to the Initial-Central-Base-Camp.
That either complex or share of its complexes to other complexes described do have some effect measurable to virtualization.
And in that way, a virtualized platform may be achieved, also showcasing an example of modules/submodules that also may additional stack in their own platform, to themselves, based off the centralization/virtualization achieved from the Initial-Central-base-camp. As the secondary-stack-chain.
What that looks like is that every super camp has 4 or so shared modules, in such a way that they may share over other platforms in their zoning, in some extent/overall virtualization of or simply by their own implant or focality in general to each platform/entirity of the post/camp/zone/node in use (and forms a self-propogated-cluster to itself in capability)
Either way of how this is set up, if virtualization is achieved, then the platform may support cluster-usage/gateway-cluster networking etc.

And in one setup in particular, that a BASE may have Stem/Stats to its sub, with an initial-centralization, as a Split/Step to its BASE and the Modules/Submodules it has platformed. That comprises as the first main-pipeline for a workspace. And the first half of the SuperCamp.
The second Half is consisted of a virtualized quarter of a "Operating System and its "SubProccess/Subsystem" for which each have their own pipelines and may sharehold/conjunct admist their own platform in anyway, and also are supported by the first half of the SuperCamp, and achieve cluster-capability on their own (or by supporting factors within their zoning and various shareholding).

--
In that way, there exists a capability to occupy/proxify capilliary/reserve/battery/sources or what soever a trail/pone that exists on perimeter of the centralized build, and may also be accounted as "auxilliary armament or expendable-infrastructure".
--
And so in the spirit of being expendable it forms a skunkworks with a deployable munition/source table for which each are considered as an inverse-gate-line (which may be inbound or outbound to the central-base)--and each of these components may be stocked/resourced with variale artifecture/architure reminescent to a skinkworks or monument/artifice/counter/bulkhead for which the list may complexify of all the structures under the Dyson-Tier.
In this way it may also secure/siege/weaponized/iron-dome upon itself and execute roaming-policy and battlefronts/checkpoints of its range.
