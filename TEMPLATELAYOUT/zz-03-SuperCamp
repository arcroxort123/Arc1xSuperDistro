This is a placeholder for any module/post/node/structure/domain/construct etc that may be placed anywhere at any time under maximal/optimized settings.

So there is a few previous rulesets in play as to what occurs at a camp/outpost and it being defined or in assets/tables or having meta or claim to anything. This is generalized as fairgrounds-policy.
This also applies or not depending on legacy/quasi conditions as that the whole situatin is dicey, but in an upgraded sense also becomes even more so...chanced as to where any action/method is basically contested or has consequences sometimes.

A superCamp acts as a spawning-node/power-spawner or homebase or any structure/tensor.
It houses a main-module/nodestack. (It requires a plant of some sort either in field/parameter/table/surface etc)
This acts as the "centralized zoning of the supercamp.
---
It may have subsets/secondary bulkheads or otherwise seconday submodules/modules that are conjunct/adherent in their own sections/parse and or standalone to a superCamp but integrated in someway as to centralize/databank/plant/template for its own zone.
