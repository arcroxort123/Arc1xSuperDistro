Quasi-Gnome/Quasi-Gnosis (Some reciprocated format of Quasi-Stats/Quasi-Tables and Data Strata)
---Well it in t heory adjusts for surfaces being used and can similarily spoof/poise to attack/launch/ activate/deactive access points to surface areas if it is in use. (As a blocker/enabler)---this involves quasi-telemetry and is difficult to get "correct by profile" but once it is set correctly it should work to advocate for Era-Implmentations (which develop a temporary-template and elevation where needed as is)
Now using this method we can coordinate quasi-builds to the system even if it is within/out-of-bounds the range-permissions/access due to elevation over and specific to the ownership/claimed survey/probe regional-tables involved (by default or otherwise in cycle by defaults or otherwise any wisdom-template/barebones build that may be implicated as in use or in coordination to any xzone (over memetic relay chains)
