Codenamed (Reverant Bridge) is a super ballast that may be fit with a dynamic-reactor to act as its own network processing station and power delivery device.
How does this work?

When I was developing the regionally patented super fuel (relax its no really patented): This was in 2021 or so and I was beginning to know I would need a system upgrade to properly automate and faciliate all the required demands of production.
So I was reasoning that it would be used with batteries.
We used reactors to make batteries and sometimes with batteries. We had a dynamic 2 stage pillar/reactor, that we could fit a battery feed onto with an adapter, but this was enough to be a dynamic-data-processor only. We needed to incorporate extra ingredients and at the time, It was the most basic thorium reactor that would use a chemical plant to filter in all the thorium, with maybe an extra grill chain to keep coolants circulating between the pipelines etc.
It was advanced, but it was not exactly fusion level. So we developed a tokamac. But there was no real way to connect these into a singular module.
--Time moved on and innnovations continued that we developed meta headers, and other things for quantum fulton integrations etc. I knew i needed more pieces, but could not find the right ones, the idea REALLY GOT SHELVED. We ended up making bridgeworks/skunkworks/endworks and expanding on those ideas. Infact, the system works well enough without any more advancements.
Infact, I almost forgot about it until now, we can use the omega/coriolis convention/auto-projector as an additional modular component to a reactor build. And it looks like that might be enough to satisfy the concept models for a self-powered/network structure. Not just an automatic omni/hyper-bridge  but one that functions as a ballast itself, giving it power and data.

So how this looks is we have a standard chemicalplant/reactor/turbine system.
Now we incorporate forks on its very endpoints, one for its starting point, the other for its outputs What this looks like is that the chemical plant splits on one end, and the turbine splits on the other, allowing for "these meta/modular components to be "interwoven/braided within".

We have our DYNAMIC DATA REACTOR/PROCESSOR--we upgrade it for thorium (secret composite fuelant processing which I have described as (zz-02-AfterMath-LoadOut(First Legacy Run)) and elsewhere:

LEFTSIDE A Extension
The chemical plant splits to allow thorium mixtures and coolants and its dumps within its own ciruculation grill. The grill can also intermesh/interthread with others directly or seperately as needed by DESIGN it can involve alot more valve work, I prefer to keep things seperate and detachable as possible. This means like an independent but inter-fitted pipeline of some sort. Not complicated, just like clasping one hands.
This is one component, there may be another spread of the grill to allow for more "interslotting between other grills in their extension/framework (this requires elongation of its pipelines to incorporate spacing for interweaving of course, or they can overlay, it doesn't really matter what works is what matters) Just getting modular components to "hypercube" together.
This eventually forms a BRIDGEWORK to the dataprocessor, and that is more or less an added capability now to accept its own trafficing for data-management without a mass-fulton-circuit-conduit-adapter. This is not a "toplevel adapter" but can also be a side adapter, or we can just use it as a built-in-bridge.
Hopefully this upgrades the dynamic-data-reactor/processor to accept thorium transmissions. (it is a little side heavy though now with the built in chemical plant being enlarged to concompass this) No biggue, just a small nitpick of design.
*SO THIS SIDE LOOKS LIKE: ExtraBridge/ExtraGrill/ExtaDataMining(Scraper Cycle)

RIGHTSIDE B Extension
So we go to the other side, and this is where it started to piece together and rebalance. (We can also do any side in any order but let me explain it)
We split the power outputs/builtin turbines to allow for the bridgework to include spacing for extra components.
These components are the Turbines/Augmented-Data-Moshing-Device/Auxilliary
*SO THIS SIDE LOOKS LIKE: ExtraTurbine/ExtraAugmented-Datamining(ScraperCycle)/Extra-Aux(Generator)

Anyways it starts to look balanced with added/improved components having been forked and fitted on either side of its casing, and can match the idea of a standalone BALLAST.
Now it 1) autoprocesses data on its network collection and also 2) converts power per its own cyclic-entry.
3) The topside adapters are still used as beacons etc if needed. Which is a plus in remote communications/dropzoning either for infosec or crypto-chains (and probably can help to commit/interact with remote buckets and their cache/loads).---infact this is why it is important because of all the dumping taking place.
Any wow-signal can be reduced to a potential mis-read/mis-fire and proven thereof in particule interactions/flukes/quarks etc. Very good in deweaponizing potential threats/signals and provided extra insulation against unexpected events.
*SO THIS TOPSIDE LOOKS LIKE: "A little more conduit/hard-wiring integrating each SIDE A AND B and deck-platform/lane)


Anyways SIDE A and SIDE B do their thing, enhance the original reactors with their newly enhanced-Chemplant/enhanced-Turbine (and topside enhanced-garbage collector)
And here we have a way to sustain an OUPHE convention. Which is just a FUSION-THORIUM-REACTOR/DYNAMIC-DATA-PROCESSOR-AUTOSIMULATOR.
This can be used as a massive power/data station for intensive manufacture/render/immersion/integrated efforts of simulation/projection and "mass-manufacture".

Once again I knew I had something here to update, and all that upgrading work that took place between its concept model and up to now, was really just the effort to even propose this idea here. Because once the fuel was upgraded, I knew there was going to be a real big pipeline I was going to have to complete, so this is why its called the SUPERBALLST/REVERANT-BRIDGE.
Also its a super blue moon soon if that matters. (I can practically see my own backyard under its lighting lol) --(lunacy much? well maybe just a little)---mm--actually--this sounds like a good sim-idea with this invention. (Exo-launcher)

Anyways. Review:
While we had a DYNAMIC-DATA-PROCESSOR/REACTOR
Now we add the Thorium-Grill for chemical/inputdata.
And we had the Omega-Chain for power/productdata.
This effectively MODULATES the DYNAMIC-DATAPROCESSOR/REACTOR and its COMPONENTS as a SUPERBALLST (and is used as a massive passthrough in Data-Manangement already, is now upgraded to include AUTOMATED-EXO-DATA-PERFORMANCES)--(while it was automated prior, this time its very insulated as its own secure-bridgework as well)

It does better in data-collection/garbage-collection because it generates all of that. (And with its superconduit top level adpater it can incorporate a inbound/outbound dataflow as it already likely has) --(A portable tokamac with its foundation basically)
It is basically a SUPERSKUNKWORKS. (An innovation upon several other innovations, mostly----the upgrading of a nuclear-chain and resourcing-expo--and the upgrading of that to include quantum bouquets and so on with AI-assistance)---(So basically its a very easily launched "auto-dev" system --like opendevin/opendevika using it in a gamespace/dreamspace with Vr-Immersion and Automated-Ai-Programming Security)
This all fits to a single fob-platform as well (and can all be built inzone and distributed per model produced)--yes (it can do it all on a single fob-platform)--becuase its catamount to its own processes)--(It can be compared to a very useful LOIC-Expansion/powerbank)---(Like an extra "memory-chip/int-gland" for symbiotic entities too) ---(Compared to a DRAGON-LAIR)
This can also be incorporated as a massive-artificial wish-making system "And masked-network auto-gen".
