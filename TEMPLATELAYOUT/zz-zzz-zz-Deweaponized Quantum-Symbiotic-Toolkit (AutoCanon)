Anyways this little thingy is also encoated with hiquarter symbiotic polymer and is basically an alien tech.
It is reserved for 'business-district' practices and is biometrically-authorized (though business level contracts may be restricted/prohibited also which diminihsing canon usage)--it is required to be authorized by ownership of the faction/system brand of mascot usage (fae/business-fae) and is basically pinstriped-by-meta.

It took a long time to make this thing look simple, and is mostly used for crypto-access/raid-lock-engagements.
It can be wielded as a thalaer/thalamancy armature (see axotol quad wield)
