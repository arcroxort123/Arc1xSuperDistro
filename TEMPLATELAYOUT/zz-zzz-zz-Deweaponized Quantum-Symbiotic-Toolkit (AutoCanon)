May Launch Meta-Capsules/Blacksite-Commodities(weaponized/consumable usages)
Anyways this little thingy is also encoated with hiquarter symbiotic polymer and is basically an alien tech.
It is reserved for 'business-district' practices and is biometrically-authorized (though business level contracts may be restricted/prohibited also which diminihsing canon usage)--it is required to be authorized by ownership of the faction/system brand of mascot usage (fae/business-fae) and is basically pinstriped-by-meta.

It took a long time to make this thing look simple, and is mostly used for crypto-access/raid-lock-engagements.
It can be wielded as a thalaer/thalamancy armature (see axotol quad wield)

LFO/UAP augmented(tab/mod) Dyson/Turing Teraformy/Crypto-Jacking Device and AutoTract(GravityLift) delivery system (high-beams/gravity gun)---and/or weaponized-distengration-ray/portal device(probably idk--timewarper/free-movemnt noclip usage).
Business District-Faction-Encoat(decorum) fit with AutoMatch/AutoSequence System-Policy(per allowance if allowed at all)--sometimes not.

Other experiments may include lfo/uap grounding-algoritmic-techqniues and microwave-injections(reverse engineering for purging/cleansing orbital meta/crypto-shields or counter-algorithms) ---or also mass censography (forced-blackboxifciation) and other float-point-based-attacks. (including ball lightning-sequencing)
