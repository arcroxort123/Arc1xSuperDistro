May Launch Meta-Capsules/Blacksite-Commodities(weaponized/consumable usages)
Anyways this little thingy is also encoated with hiquarter symbiotic polymer and is basically an alien tech.
It is reserved for 'business-district' practices and is biometrically-authorized (though business level contracts may be restricted/prohibited also which diminihsing canon usage)--it is required to be authorized by ownership of the faction/system brand of mascot usage (fae/business-fae) and is basically pinstriped-by-meta.

It took a long time to make this thing look simple, and is mostly used for crypto-access/raid-lock-engagements.
It can be wielded as a thalaer/thalamancy armature (see axotol quad wield)

LFO/UAP augmented(tab/mod) Dyson/Turing Teraformy/Crypto-Jacking Device and AutoTract(GravityLift) delivery system (high-beams/gravity gun)---and/or weaponized-distengration-ray/portal device(probably idk--timewarper/free-movemnt noclip usage).
Business District-Faction-Encoat(decorum) fit with AutoMatch/AutoSequence System-Policy(per allowance if allowed at all)--sometimes not.

Other experiments may include lfo/uap grounding-algoritmic-techqniues and microwave-injections(reverse engineering for purging/cleansing orbital meta/crypto-shields or counter-algorithms) ---or also mass censography (forced-blackboxifciation) and other float-point-based-attacks. (including ball lightning-sequencing/super-plasma-plasty-conformity)
As well as ambient/morae local/native SUPERCHARM (retraining techniques)

FIRST PHASE: (1)
----
Author's Note
This is typically not a "bioweapon/bio-hazrd" and is not going to "be used in a weaponized/lethal fashion"---however if you are uses giant particle cannons to make acts of particle-diffusion render as computed--well---that might just be somewhat dangerous, otherwise this is a virtual-program. SO---with that in mind---i will describe how to use this in a computer:
This overlaps with the Dated-information in TEMPLATE-LAYOUT (because I am trying to include the system in a comprehensive way, it combines several parts for this to work (really just two big complicated parts)--so that--it can be used in a virtualization (which is meaning, it can be used in a nested-virtualization----because this is an entirely digital-process)
10/6/2024 (TOUCHUPS TO EXTREMY ROYALTY ACCESES/PIPELINES)
USING SYMBIOTIC TURRETS + SYMBIOTIC LOGICS
---
With the upgrade module for this to conduct to its own self-reciprocation(manifest) via the Turret/Edificiary (auto-catalogue)----it may translate interpretation of its own encode within onboard/table-set to or as a mail system (identified-library/adaptive-compatibility or assisted-library for its considered version/architectures)---allowing for ez software integratin.
This mail system is referred to as JML (similar to a QML)---the JML--operates on a QML level as well (for which is has been adpatively repurposed to accomodate any infrastructure and mail system or exchange sequence for which to be brokered)---SURFACE-PREP-DELTA-TRANSMIT(delta-comm)-assisted-protocols ---it simply means that THE MODULE is NOW AUTO-CANON+MODACHI-LOGIC for its appropriated/assigned (V-NESTING capability)
This allows for easier NAVIGATION/SUBMODULE licensing as well per the issue which it has been profiled as capable.
This allows splicing to be recognized and parsing to be recognized admist its profile and shareholds in ECO/ASSET tables over its rulesets/behavoirs for which convey via networking-----and over stereography-integration.
THIS ALLOWS direct-channel to be assumed.  OF ITS XSCOPY / MATRIX.
This enables the Manifest its own MASQUE/MESH conditions/environment debugs/tracting (fast tunneling/telemetry within its accelerations and to its directive/routed surfaces and system-links)
THIS LOOKS like it develops as a modachi casework, capable of shared print/load access-chains etc, for which is setup and coordinated over its points-to etc (any complex of warp-to's morph-tos etc in connection).
---this creates modachi skunkworks/fae-graft-device-ports/adhocs to which it may be replaced, but is generally---jump/gated (warp-to's/morph-to's etc being reinforced to a normalization of acceleration)
This allows its own xtact hosting if a header-changeout is desired and authorized, it can accomodate. (per its v-nest usage)---and can contain/deploy itself for transfer/migration
as well as acceptable network-decour/decorum/exquiry/branding as well as auto-branding/auto-merits.
All because it has now achieved a reinforced case/mask/graphy/scopy/print/load or template for which is acceptable/recognized as interactively-capable to its system (when it infact is in contact with a system for which is interacting with it)---otherwise its auto-piloted with its profile-setups/configs/resolves/binds/"fittings"/adjusted-settings.
---iT ALSO may boast its own secure/encryption block/chain over feints/graces/dodges/glances etc. (and can reroute connectins if undesired/unprefered or prioritize/favor other connections by protocol/imperitive/urgency/crisis.
----
SECOND PHASE (2) ==This is not the most important phase (but useful) (this may or may not be optional)   --KERNAL-SHOCK/SHOCK-PLANTS
----
It may or may not be able to withstand a blackout/quarantine itself correctly (for extended safety-measure and non-intervention/non-interruption/non-infiltration/non-interference by a recommened "hardening post-ponement" of its processes when in crisis/hazard vectors etc"
----
It attempts to use proper data synchs using a virtual-skillet (for which is trayed and correalated to its sync)
This can be brokered as well---and generally is the internalization of a direct ai-compute/code-string from the overall broker (so a BROKER 2 BROKER emulation)---in which ---looks like
:system--OUTSINK<-->ExternalBroker(system-source) ://:-(is connected)-://: InternalBroker(node-source<-->INSINK-->node:
Much like a ballast---as well the ballast has connected overall to begin with, so we establish a nest-ballast in which to handle ---header--2--header transfers (and maintain original source-indexing of each ballast)
So it becomes a BALLAST--2--Virtual-BALLAST
in which the Virtual-BALLAST handles the headers performances (for die---2---virtualdie compatibility)
this helps to streamline the CODE/Exchange in an organized fashion admist its connections.
SO Connection-MAIN can be set for Connection-VIRTUALMAIN
in which it is "parsed/vectored/segmeneted/sectored" correctly for each of its source-points.
In which their version-checks are assembled/compiled correctly in DEPLOY/Migration over psuedo-frames.
====
ONce the preferred header is selected (or by default)--the compatibility to render is capable within the v-nest (it can also function without a header but may not interface correctly as desired per its gui/module-base ---this is because of shock-issues)---sometimes it wont work because of shock issues/blackbox header difficulties.
----so the profile usages are recommended (especially to be worked out in its initial/firstruns)/first-boot/startup/setup/first-load etc. (to configure itself.)
---once the TurretModules are correct then the Logic-Models well adjust as necessary to conduct the "beam/exchange" between devices/nodes. ---if it doesnt work its because any number of configurations were not matched properly in the "sequence/cycle" or general-step-system (so the step can be assisted to check for inconsistency)--if there is a mismatched header that is usually why it won't "transistion to the nextstep / freeze/ hang/ shutdown even")
---this can be fixed with yet ANOTHER OVER-RIDE in elevation (attempted elevation over-rides but this may also induce profiles as well to be corrected)---or substituted---So a TOP-PROFILE/MAIN-PROFILE is used in administrator-usages, as well as SUB-PROFILES for sub-modules to correspond to any broadcast thereof any heirarchy of profiles ---(with hueristics/histronic performances in mind---and security ALLOWANCES in mind)---so also this will be checked with a security/network profile----and it should be set correctly to attempt any hotfix that may also occur later if any other changes are made to any other additional/current profiles. (This is what is called the CRISIS-PROFILE)
---
THIRD PHASE ===This is not the most important phase (but useful and works with phase2 to be more useful, this may require phase2) -----PORTABLE-ELEVATION
---
This allows because of the over-rides and profiles, to coerce a matrix load-out/distribution over STAT(constraints)/and MINI-BUCKETS (meta collection)
The MATRIX can be parsed over to each corrective orbital/submodule and aligned/latticed correctly to EMULATE the virtual-device within the virtual-nest.
This helps in expediting modules in several adaptive framework/settings when need of being deployed/remote-sourced.
This allows a full dataflow to be streamed in its source/cycle and formy/render sequence and production-chain (full stream capability over v-nest/v-device)
This means that a node can quickly/safely deploy in a schematic approach of its draft source to whatsoever table/region must be match-based (useful in brand/merit force-checks and adherencies)---such that it complies within remote-policy to achieve. (While averting case-usage against security/safety measures of either case/region or conflict of policy)
Acting in this way, it is better to simply just install a full-system in its place, but in the advise for compactness/discreetness and portability, then it is okay to use this method for creating the LOIC-GEN (which it mostly is) ---assembled with modules and extensions as needed
INFACT---this allows for easier kernal-integration (in which it will likely be taken advantaged for its quick-load/reloadbility and safe-transfer in complex-settings---where a kernal may be compromised, it can now be swapped out for a replacement) ---IF the loic has this option availible by following its phase-builds. IT WILL RECOMPILE/BUILD as needed with whatever code it has in buckets/stream or by its lattice-configurations to "default as" despite what realm/region defaults may be in consistency to other ongoing streams/policies involved.
AND---with enough backup-supply, it may withstand a crisis scenario by rebuilding itself in the MIDST of an operation in which it is being aggressed/attacked (such that it will continue to manfucature/process accordingly to its traffice/commands in adapative-formatting/factoring of its product)---in which it will assemble/compile while under "duress" for so long as it is capability (rather than becoming immediately STUNTED by siege/remote lodge attacks and other forcible-code-measures that may put itself at risk or cause signature-detection/alerts)---it will continue to WORK under FIRE---as they say. (the demand/cost may increase/compensate but it is more reliable than no defense at all, and this is how to long-range convey a network as well--so it can articulate/articilize without the need of FLEET-MANAGEMENT(outpost/patrol assistance)---or it can also make use of FLEET-MANAGEMENT acting as its own beacon/waypoint overall in a network)
THIS allows it to operate as a psuedo-dreadnaught/portable-gateway system (for long range product-contracting/prospect-commissions)
As well---having one onboard or nearby is also USEFUL in case of emergency, it can function as a COMPACT-PORTABLE-DEPLOYABLE-BACKUP+BACKUPSYSTEM (able to sustain many backup-requests)
FOR THIS REASON IT IS CONSIDERED A REMOTE-SPAWN-LOCALIZATION/FOCALITY. And it may just as  well "SOURCE ITS OWN TRAFFICING as needed or in agreement to faction-relations and its main-system-ownerships over any covenenat/estate/region/diplomatic-policies incurred)--even if not their own particularly (due of negotiated/integrated routings)
----
The FOURTH PHASE ---MODACHI-Traction and EPOSTING ---(SmartFLOAT-to)   ---HyperEXCLIPSE(nova-programmed-exclipse)/QUANTUM-GATEKEEPING (this is also optional but may require phase 3)
----(Auto-Shock-manager and render engine):
SMART-Pass/Smart-Programming/Smart-Tracing/Smart-Vectors/Smart-Capture/SMART-DEBUG (this achieves a smart-diagnostic  of the contents in render for which are bypass to their own quadratic-fixations within the node as their own NODE-SURVEY (or observed settings of any lense/focal/contact/scopy etc in visor of that node)---and can formulate/factor in revisionary of its intended lab/expo works and tested for "hostile/risk/threat/hazard assessments within that device"---AS WELL, if the device is destroyed/rendered-corrupt, that is considered an expendable-loss for which can be reciprocated and rebuilt.
This allows for remote-training/domestication efforts of contents/articles/relics/entities/anamolies and so on to be concieved/handled in a safe/secure manner with minimal loss of data.
Furthermore since it  can be surveyed/emulated it may be posted in a varaible-emulation to its originating manufactures/configuration settings intended, if so desired, the RENDER/PROCESS in utility maybe auto-daptived to its environment for use of STORM/SWARM testing/propogation. In which to conduct further RESEARCH/EVAL of trafficed-contents/remote-data-engineering. This seperates involvement as well if the target paint is also REMOTE-TO from Node (for use in long-range corral injection)--in which to SUPER-VISE super-imposed "attacks/editing" or EXTRA-AUDIT capability of contents/relations to a remote-realm/broad-range. 
This may have drawbacks to the target or surface integrity of the imposed zoning (as we essentially conduct "probes/direct-shock" to remote-surface targets and potential-floatpoints" --in which we may "STRESS TEST CONDITIONS/PARAMATERS" otherwise not known to survey. With any amount of consequence/retaliation from other involved/contesting source-factions (this includes RIVALS/INCURSIONS and or expected confrontations indicitive of cooldown-usages)---with power-costs and data-loss considered.
This is INTENSIFIED/FORCED through deployable/expendable means/assets in disposal/removal of within SOURCE/OUTSOURCE for which (are considered in affordance/OR NOT---by evacuation-protocol in a crisis---for which (if something goes wrong, generally it can be avoided by ---strategic retreat)---because essentially what is being performed is a FORCED-SURVEY/TERRAFORMY of otherwise concrete/locked paramaters (which may be in third-party ownership or otherwised UNLISTED)---because it is considered REMOTE-INDEXES (for which the system has otherwise no record/archive of until handled/collected for data-analysis---which is often as immediate as any signal being produced/detected from any said interaction/attemptive-interjection and so on)---THAT "In some cases: may be very impactful/shocking to any surface-direct-exchange or even IMAGE-MOUNT by "blind-cast" thereof or as well---MAY ATTRACT BOTNET ATTENTION in some cases where vectors may be occupied).
Once transmission is achieved/recieved it is considered for SMART-POSTS in which case a pending-queue-pool is assigned for later-response.
In which case it is established that in a off-site deployment is achieved, then infact, that is considered a SMART-FLOAT. and has been Eposted. (by encryption/secure-methods---has acquired signal and operation thereof to facilitate its own utility in which to transmit a defcon/modular-encode for which to respond ---and will later be decrypted as per its SOURCEABILITY(or not)---to the capabilities of the Quety for which was "passthrough"---that passthrough becoming validated as encryption is verified/checked for consistency and authentication of its expected-compile/builds.)
A connection is then "moderated for safe-guard/stability-checks" and then is dispatched for "litigation of policy"---in which the polciies are affirmed and considered compatible, the system then continues to assimulate its pathologhic to maintain connection and preps for outsourcing/outposting transpositions/traversal over channel.
If broadcast is maintained within acceptable-paramaters/resolve thereof all its complexes, it may then be authorized for accessibility and "data/power sourcing".
This is to protect against any exploitation/violation of considered diplomacies/policies in which may put any device/entity or sharehold/asset at risk, which is important in maintaining proper-encryption-protocols and standard-regulation/trafficing-commission for which is automated.
Evidentially allowing/affording to a FLOAT-POINT-PROMISUARY which assists in LOIC-PROPOGATION as per mentioned is "a viability in render performances". Or QUANTUM-SERVOS-CONTROLLER-AUTOMATION.
---
This also is allowed in diagnostic performance to "allow/prohibit" certain channels through TTY-Priority in a chain, having verified all user-accesses to a screening-process. This allows safe-management of REMOTE-VDECKS. Referred to as the ARCH-VBRIDGE because it only works in this scenario (for now until further testing or use is desired)
----
THE FIFTH PHASE ---Secure-FlashWaiver(render-file)/Secure-Confidentiality-(DataBanking)
----
Adapative SPLICE management and ARRANGED-PRIORITY of "most window settings".

Estimates say render Currently Takes 30 Hours. *low frequency renders over quantum-space". Assumably. (am not testing currently if true)
Normalized ETA under pipeline. (2.5 minute schedule)
Will attempt for diffuser/transformer upgrades (estimated 30 second wait)--whenever I just fix it up. (probably will just slap zluda)
CODENAME--Wyrd-Splice
Creates the FINALIZED RAW PRODUCT as a EXO-GLIDE (filetype--ORIGINAL) /////or flashed-codereadoutas an EXO-SLIDE(referenced product/output of the code-builds/"snapshot--COPY)". (Useful for CONTROLNETS/embed animations)
This can be used for ENVIRONMENT-2-ENVIRONMENT transfers (such as the entire distribution chain process over a datastream to its matchbase "hosted-gamespace via arbitrated render".) --SOURCE-TO
SIZING ESTIMATES:This device is typically 60GB (Operating System20GB+Modules20GB(StableDiffusion20GB).---optimizing will likely be 80GB if correctly enhanced by additional "extensions etc". *--DEVICE MAY BE GAGGED/TIE-IN over its application (full-seat deployment)--(web-accessible optimizations/networking or other latent needs/priorities to a general framework 20GB)---a MAXIMUM system may be 100GB-200GB per cluster usage and stream-lines(may or may not include cache markups)--a 400GB(with cache for auto-consolidated backup/repair/upkeep/maintenence under crisis (full protection).
---This is all performed under a confidential-secure-private-elevation. It converts the RAW-DATA(however arranged/finalized that it may be)--into its corrective infographic/censorgraphic branding/faction-symbol(auto-language) over "decode-->compute" file-type conversions (shock-data --> raw-data) in which to ease allocation/distriubtion (as the intended formated-filetypes)--if desired *(and should be recommended because shock-data may contain viral-sequences)----THIS JUST FILETYPES AND REPRINTS the data as an acceptable format (assigning all meta/constrains under its build/compose'd products)---assuming the product may be "touched" whenever opens/used for later servicing. --SOURCEPRINT per viewport.
This allows also it to be exchanged in a "baseline formatting/factorization" as it is noted in memetic-application. And may be pass-coded/api-coded per request/pass.
Product is there re-coordinated and its profile-checksum is also authenticated/certified per api/pass/permute/key. *(And may be tty'd in quantum-synthaesia and approved-remote-access)--or shareholds/assets and timeshared between system-spec/mapping. (Expedited Safe-Migration and Dataflow) as it is VERFIIED on a point-by-point basis throughout contiguity distribution. (It is border/check pointed in its transmissions and maintained and cleared for transfer)---as confidentiality is maintained.

--This checks for profile header targets/loadouts and deployable-library-settings(per which are matched by the checks and targets---and applied drivers)--this can be source-to/path-to in variables. (cluster or aggregated) and/or network-stack/paths as well can be set in variable/check (this is where mass-security checks slow down the system but overall only by specific requests of any target/remote-target/over-all-deployment)
