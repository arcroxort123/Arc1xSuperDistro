May Launch Meta-Capsules/Blacksite-Commodities(weaponized/consumable usages)
Anyways this little thingy is also encoated with hiquarter symbiotic polymer and is basically an alien tech.
It is reserved for 'business-district' practices and is biometrically-authorized (though business level contracts may be restricted/prohibited also which diminihsing canon usage)--it is required to be authorized by ownership of the faction/system brand of mascot usage (fae/business-fae) and is basically pinstriped-by-meta.

It took a long time to make this thing look simple, and is mostly used for crypto-access/raid-lock-engagements.
It can be wielded as a thalaer/thalamancy armature (see axotol quad wield)

LFO/UAP augmented(tab/mod) Dyson/Turing Teraformy/Crypto-Jacking Device and AutoTract(GravityLift) delivery system (high-beams/gravity gun)---and/or weaponized-distengration-ray/portal device(probably idk--timewarper/free-movemnt noclip usage).
Business District-Faction-Encoat(decorum) fit with AutoMatch/AutoSequence System-Policy(per allowance if allowed at all)--sometimes not.

Other experiments may include lfo/uap grounding-algoritmic-techqniues and microwave-injections(reverse engineering for purging/cleansing orbital meta/crypto-shields or counter-algorithms) ---or also mass censography (forced-blackboxifciation) and other float-point-based-attacks. (including ball lightning-sequencing/super-plasma-plasty-conformity)
As well as ambient/morae local/native SUPERCHARM (retraining techniques)

FIRST PHASE: (1)
----
Author's Note
This is typically not a "bioweapon/bio-hazrd" and is not going to "be used in a weaponized/lethal fashion"---however if you are uses giant particle cannons to make acts of particle-diffusion render as computed--well---that might just be somewhat dangerous, otherwise this is a virtual-program. SO---with that in mind---i will describe how to use this in a computer:
This overlaps with the Dated-information in TEMPLATE-LAYOUT (because I am trying to include the system in a comprehensive way, it combines several parts for this to work (really just two big complicated parts)--so that--it can be used in a virtualization (which is meaning, it can be used in a nested-virtualization----because this is an entirely digital-process)

USING SYMBIOTIC TURRETS + SYMBIOTIC LOGICS
---
With the upgrade module for this to conduct to its own self-reciprocation(manifest) via the Turret/Edificiary (auto-catalogue)----it may translate interpretation of its own encode within onboard/table-set to or as a mail system (identified-library/adaptive-compatibility or assisted-library for its considered version/architectures)---allowing for ez software integratin.
This mail system is referred to as JML (similar to a QML)---the JML--operates on a QML level as well (for which is has been adpatively repurposed to accomodate any infrastructure and mail system or exchange sequence for which to be brokered)---SURFACE-PREP-DELTA-TRANSMIT(delta-comm)-assisted-protocols ---it simply means that THE MODULE is NOW AUTO-CANON+MODACHI-LOGIC for its appropriated/assigned (V-NESTING capability)
This allows for easier NAVIGATION/SUBMODULE licensing as well per the issue which it has been profiled as capable.
This allows splicing to be recognized and parsing to be recognized admist its profile and shareholds in ECO/ASSET tables over its rulesets/behavoirs for which convey via networking-----and over stereography-integration.
THIS ALLOWS direct-channel to be assumed.  OF ITS XSCOPY / MATRIX.
This enables the Manifest its own MASQUE/MESH conditions/environment debugs/tracting (fast tunneling/telemetry within its accelerations and to its directive/routed surfaces and system-links)
THIS LOOKS like it develops as a modachi casework, capable of shared print/load access-chains etc, for which is setup and coordinated over its points-to etc (any complex of warp-to's morph-tos etc in connection).
---this creates modachi skunkworks/fae-graft-device-ports/adhocs to which it may be replaced, but is generally---jump/gated (warp-to's/morph-to's etc being reinforced to a normalization of acceleration)
This allows its own xtact hosting if a header-changeout is desired and authorized, it can accomodate. (per its v-nest usage)---and can contain/deploy itself for transfer/migration
as well as acceptable network-decour/decorum/exquiry/branding as well as auto-branding/auto-merits.
All because it has now achieved a reinforced case/mask/graphy/scopy/print/load or template for which is acceptable/recognized as interactively-capable to its system (when it infact is in contact with a system for which is interacting with it)---otherwise its auto-piloted with its profile-setups/configs/resolves/binds/"fittings"/adjusted-settings.
---iT ALSO may boast its own secure/encryption block/chain over feints/graces/dodges/glances etc. (and can reroute connectins if undesired/unprefered or prioritize/favor other connections by protocol/imperitive/urgency/crisis.
----
SECOND PHASE (2) ==This is not the most important phase (but useful) (this may or may not be optional)
----
It may or may not be able to withstand a blackout/quarantine itself correctly (for extended safety-measure and non-intervention/non-interruption/non-infiltration/non-interference by a recommened "hardening post-ponement" of its processes when in crisis/hazard vectors etc"
----
It attempts to use proper data synchs using a virtual-skillet (for which is trayed and correalated to its sync)
This can be brokered as well---and generally is the internalization of a direct ai-compute/code-string from the overall broker (so a BROKER 2 BROKER emulation)---in which ---looks like
:system--OUTSINK<-->ExternalBroker(system-source) ://:-(is connected)-://: InternalBroker(node-source<-->INSINK-->node:
Much like a ballast---as well the ballast has connected overall to begin with, so we establish a nest-ballast in which to handle ---header--2--header transfers (and maintain original source-indexing of each ballast)
So it becomes a BALLAST--2--Virtual-BALLAST
in which the Virtual-BALLAST handles the headers performances (for die---2---virtualdie compatibility)
this helps to streamline the CODE/Exchange in an organized fashion admist its connections.
SO Connection-MAIN can be set for Connection-VIRTUALMAIN
in which it is "parsed/vectored/segmeneted/sectored" correctly for each of its source-points.
In which their version-checks are assembled/compiled correctly in DEPLOY/Migration over psuedo-frames.
====
ONce the preferred header is selected (or by default)--the compatibility to render is capable within the v-nest (it can also function without a header but may not interface correctly as desired per its gui/module-base ---this is because of shock-issues)---sometimes it wont work because of shock issues/blackbox header difficulties.
----so the profile usages are recommended (especially to be worked out in its initial/firstruns)/first-boot/startup/setup/first-load etc. (to configure itself.)
---once the TurretModules are correct then the Logic-Models well adjust as necessary to conduct the "beam/exchange" between devices/nodes. ---if it doesnt work its because any number of configurations were not matched properly in the "sequence/cycle" or general-step-system (so the step can be assisted to check for inconsistency)--if there is a mismatched header that is usually why it won't "transistion to the nextstep / freeze/ hang/ shutdown even")
---this can be fixed with yet ANOTHER OVER-RIDE in elevation (attempted elevation over-rides but this may also induce profiles as well to be corrected)---or substituted---So a TOP-PROFILE/MAIN-PROFILE is used in administrator-usages, as well as SUB-PROFILES for sub-modules to correspond to any broadcast thereof any heirarchy of profiles ---(with hueristics/histronic performances in mind---and security ALLOWANCES in mind)---so also this will be checked with a security/network profile----and it should be set correctly to attempt any hotfix that may also occur later if any other changes are made to any other additional/current profiles. (This is what is called the CRISIS-PROFILE)
---
THIRD PHASE ===This is not the most important phase (but useful and works with phase2 to be more useful, this may require phase2)
---
This allows because of the over-rides and profiles, to coerce a matrix load-out/distribution over STAT(constraints)/and MINI-BUCKETS (meta collection)
The MATRIX can be parsed over to each corrective orbital/submodule and aligned/latticed correctly to EMULATE the virtual-device within the virtual-nest.
This helps in expediting modules in several adaptive framework/settings when need of being deployed/remote-sourced.
This allows a full dataflow to be streamed in its source/cycle and formy/render sequence and production-chain (full stream capability over v-nest/v-device)
This means that a node can quickly/safely deploy in a schematic approach of its draft source to whatsoever table/region must be match-based (useful in brand/merit force-checks and adherencies)---such that it complies within remote-policy to achieve. (While averting case-usage against security/safety measures of either case/region or conflict of policy)
Acting in this way, it is better to simply just install a full-system in its place, but in the advise for compactness/discreetness and portability, then it is okay to use this method for creating the LOIC-GEN (which it mostly is) ---assembled with modules and extensions as needed
INFACT---this allows for easier kernal-integration (in which it will likely be taken advantaged for its quick-load/reloadbility and safe-transfer in complex-settings---where a kernal may be compromised, it can now be swapped out for a replacement) ---IF the loic has this option availible by following its phase-builds. IT WILL RECOMPILE/BUILD as needed with whatever code it has in buckets/stream or by its lattice-configurations to "default as" despite what realm/region defaults may be in consistency to other ongoing streams/policies involved.
