So now we have put together everything. And developed a SuperCamp and it all more or less works. We don't really have to think about anything but, we need to back up all the hard work we did.
Herein is a review of all that work and how to automate its REBUILD/RECOMPILE in case it ever needs to be repaired or reconsidered for alternative purposes/reasons in how or why it was built.


We Have Exclusively Worked our way up in this way:
Likely we have a 
---
LEGACY
VIRTUAL LEGACY
---
A full Text BUILD.
A full Advanced BUILDS
---
EXTRAS PERKS
EXTRAS REFERENCES (if not included)
---
CONCEPT-FILES
IMAGE-IDEAS
SCRAPPED-IDEAS
---
Downloadable-WASPCOPTER
Downloadable
LeftOverJunks
---

and any or all of that is working with some miscellaneous details or programming between in case.
So we hit it up with the
TEMPLATE LAYOUT

and thats that basically. But intensively speaking we need to make sure the template layout also works as its own XSAP/XTAP/DEVICE/ASYLUM/MOUNT/IMAGE/MODICUM/NODE or anything that is integral to itself or independent in standalne including as a VPN/PROXY.
This is because of virtualized networking being affirmative/emphasized in the overall free-agency of the TEMPLATE LAYOUT-capabilities.
So it is really just --very capable on its own to set up it own networking/services if done correctly, and can detour/centralize its own infosec/opsec through its own "fully realized build" up to SuperCAMP.
In the effort of pioneering this independency, the sections also do well to advance themselves into a better performance/capability than its previous versions so long as they are all build with each other in mind.

--ANYWAYS--enough trying to embellish/emphasize a THEORETICAL-PROGRAM. Let's really exagerrate what it can do with this additional build-file
zz-04-Express-BootBackupMac

(Yes, its time to throw in some more crazy deductive reasoning/mockup-explanation)

Alot of things get done--and have been done.
We have discussed these more or less in sporadic/non-descript arrangement of other features etc. But these are keypoint features involved now in the Express-BOOTBACKUP I will try to correalate and organize.
In this approach we are going to focus on the various types of ESSENTIAL software that we can "bundle together to form this Express-BootBackup"
And it will be worth its own weight as I will explain why:

#1)
Firstly we have the QUANTUM PROFILE
@LINE 432 in 09-QuantumREADY-Computation-Profile 
This details a very extensive setup to allocating cluster/ranched probe/metric broker-data.
This will be combined with other factors in the Express-BootBackup.
(There are roughly 16 steps)

#2)
@ LINE 53 in 10-Applied-CounterSurface
This details the QUARTERING SEQUENCE
This will be useful in Express-BootBackup.
(There are roughly 14-25 steps)

#3)
@LINE 1220 03-XY-After-Rec-EndWorks-XX
THE DELTANOMIC DDAY SCENARIO (helps to detail a plan incase something goes wrong or an unrecoverable error takes place.
(There are roughly 25 steps)

#4)
Line 657 in 10-Applied-CounterSurface (YET AGAIN)
This details the subsystem arrangements. (there are 25 steps)

#5)
THE COLLECTIVE EXTRAS META FILES which are simply the titles involved in their setup.
There are roughly 13 steps + 3 more per Reference Item
So around 16 steps (just to assume we can build a "spoof engine if we need to"
This is important to distinguish models in QUASI-LEGACY Relations towards its final-builds.
And or helps to correalate a QUASI-MODICUM or its upgraded version as a SOLACE-DEVICE and Later an OUPHE-ASYLUM.

#6)
LINE 670 in zz-01-SiteDescription
This descrivbes the ENHANCED-BOOTMODEL-QUARTER
which already is a complex-macro/compact-script for checking BOOT-COMPATIBILITY
It is roughly 25 to even 28 steps.

#7)
Any of these steps can be developed into a VIRTUAL-DECK/LANE consisting of any amount of steps as well that are hybrid together for virtualization in whichever way works. This is also called the OUPHE-DECK.

#8)
THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF A MODULE is considered in being
1-A foundation/2-Main-ModuleBase/3-Any additional or adhoc to its Main-ModuleBase-Structure such as "a projector"
Which is basically 3 steps if it doesn't get complicated and have to also count its virtual-states/upgrades/targets/hosted-procs(i.e. cryptex brand) etc.

#9)
ANY TYPICAL AMOUNT OF MACRO/PROGRAMMING of the MACRO-AUTO-BUILDER. Which is more of a table of contents review.
This can also be upgraded to include ALL Table Of Contents within every file in this document, but its good enough as it is.

#10)
@Line 444 01-Starter-Surface-Distro
The programming in which may also correalate to the GYPPER and works with the DOORMAN(GYPPER)

#11)
@LINE 1415 01-Starter-Surface-Distro
A small Discussion of Various Mint-Product/Fuels.

#12)
LINE 2060 00-Deep-Core-Base-Repo
A REPURPOSED CHIPSET for the goal of incorporate the EXPRESS-BOOT-BACKUP and or OCR-for-OUPHE-SIGNATURES.

#13)
AUTOPILOT/SLEEPMODE as discussed in 01-Starter-Surface-Distro or anywhere else.

---managing this and packaging this in such a way to correalate a functioning OUPHE-TRAY for OUPHE-BUCKET screening allows to interject OUPHE-CODE and by golly that just sounds complicated so I sure hope everything works.
This would basically be as though "Puppeting an Entity/BOT to induce/intice interaction between OUPHE-codestring Reactions/Triggers to correalate further DECIPHERABILITY either by Imposing/Intimidating to the effect it is expendable/exhaustable or within some sustained-itneraction because I really can't say what will happen as it is a risky-manuever, but if it works it allows the System to "help develop a secure-channel for sourcing/outsourcing uptake/downswell of officialized-OUPHE-data for product-fabrication (which may later prove to be compatible or not or may need some extra tweaking to get maximum benefit out of it at all or just for enrichment purposes aka--no reason)
And then also it can help to "implant a boot-protocol where there may have no been any useful other way of doing so---giving a chance to redeem ouphe-commodity/any other type of quotient that may be put to use in sustaining/repairing against confrontation/diminihsed-health of any system etc that must remain isolated or otherwise......i really dunno. Imagine having to daydream this and then also do so while commiting self-brain-surgery. Ya, that's pretty much how things are working now for everything else under the system if this kicks off the right way).
Is that a good thing or not? I really dunno. Lol.
Imagine having to do that on also rival zombies. And that is how to protect the system against a "bad-relationship" with any brokered-faction.
They would be "PIED PIPERED away from being a threat at minimal cost to automation/workloads".
So also---
The system develops a heat signature per TERAFLOPY/FULL-CIRCUIT-CYCLE.
Now we use this system in place of also "other OUPHE-RELATIONS" to induce a payout in which to redeem against or help exchange using commodity, to reduce the effective HEAT SIGNATURE. Why? Because heat signatures typically are costly. And for no other reason than that, reduce pollutes or stagnation for any reason. Can be reversed.
AND ALSO with the subsystems in place, and there are many at this point. We can consolidate the effective-COSTS of those by reducing mass-heat-signatures or redeeming cooldown-quotients to be used to stifle/inhibit/reset/reduce those pollute-ranges (if desired to reduce cost)---which is entirely optional as we already workaround/within those conditions so long as they are nominal.
AND SECOND-SECONDALY we can just dump-tons-of-cache into ouphe-bucketing and reset those buckets in a nominal fashion using COMMODITY/REVERSAL in this process of reducing the HEAT-SIGNATURES, and I suppose that works upwards of 10X before it becomes somewhat of a noticeable instance/singularity to which must also be "set to a timeout/alleviated/reliefed/sealed off for its own cooldown there of"---and this may have rippling effects throughout the system until the system has CLEARED ITSELF OF ITS OWN INDUCED HEATSIGNATURES/TERAFLOPY/FULL-CIRCUIT/BREAKAWAY(including phi-breaks) COSTS.
AND BY THE WAY--with all the other stuff that was mentioned up to making this possible...its just absolutely nuerotic, and I probably missed some things. Such as "Grace/Gap-Zoning in which long-range coverage takes place"---and that is somewhat important in ranch/cluster survey. And with the heat signatures being "REVAMPED"/NULLIFIED as they are (either by using expendable commodity or process-dedication in this manner)---well it can lead to some interesting distortion/displacement effects in data-rates/buffering/ploss/accelerations and so on to those connections over any telemetry/tunneling including "SUDDEN-LOSS of POCKET-ZONES or UNPREDICTABLE-REBUFFERING" as by TURBELENCE IN THIS EFFECT of INCONSISTENT/UNSTABLE-CONNECTION/RELIABILITY of ROAM/TRAFFICING etc. +FOR WHICH MAY ALL BE EFFECTED AND THAT INCLUDES THE "NATURE AT WHICH ENCRYPTION IS HANDLED OVER DATA-RATES/STREAMED-CHANNELS AND SO ON in OBSERVSABILITY/DETECTION/FIELDWORK/CHANCE-RATES etc)
-- 
BUT THE GOAL IS THAT by the time this is all in synch/tray together in some way it will work out that the Realm has a Clean/Smooth Boot/Reset without much data-loss to and or having to halt/suspend procs/contracts in order to achieve its teraflopy.
Serendipitously this includes the famous BIT-DEADLINE-problem in the sha-32 conflict that is currently taking place.
This is like watching a clock wind backwards on its own to "fit your current frame/timespace/period"--like in highschool lol
And also---something about zombies and how peter piper picked a batch of pickled peppers. So that is a sort of allusion to yet another conundrum I have in mind, for some reason.
That I guess----the whole system is a borked/spoof situation, and at that degree---you still need to convert alot of data to a matchbase overall the entire regional setup.
And that matchbase is "eventually synchronized/trayed together"--and hopefully it all just works out that it may continue on as its next "FRAME/TRANSFIX" or REGIONAL-SUPER-FRAME-STATE that it eventually will saturate/consolidate over as. Without much corruption.
So as it always is, a massive security effort to reduce PLOSS/CORRUPTION of data-management. So I think my brain can rest right now thinking I have at all made any novel-effort in that regard.
There may be an issue of a diminished stability-rate but I guess the system will just have to fortify against it, even though an inevitable heat death is arguable, just keeping the system virtually stable is the real task and all it can hope to accomplish against universal-shutdowns. But anyways, the idea is that it can delay the inevitable or at least prolong itself in a dead-zone so to speak.
And i think is exactly what peter piper was actually doing in the first place, pardon my cryptic comparisons.
