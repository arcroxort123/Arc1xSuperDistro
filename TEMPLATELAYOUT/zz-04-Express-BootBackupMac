So now we have put together everything. And developed a SuperCamp and it all more or less works. We don't really have to think about anything but, we need to back up all the hard work we did.
Herein is a review of all that work and how to automate its REBUILD/RECOMPILE in case it ever needs to be repaired or reconsidered for alternative purposes/reasons in how or why it was built.

We Have Exclusively Worked our way up in this way:
SafeProtocol
Template-layout-BUILD
zz-01-SiteDescription
zz-02-AfterMath-LoadOut(First Legacy Run)
zz-03-SuperCamp
