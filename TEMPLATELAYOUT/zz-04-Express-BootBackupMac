So now we have put together everything. And developed a SuperCamp and it all more or less works. We don't really have to think about anything but, we need to back up all the hard work we did.
Herein is a review of all that work and how to automate its REBUILD/RECOMPILE in case it ever needs to be repaired or reconsidered for alternative purposes/reasons in how or why it was built.


We Have Exclusively Worked our way up in this way:
Likely we have a 
---
LEGACY
VIRTUAL LEGACY
---
A full Text BUILD.
A full Advanced BUILDS
---
EXTRAS PERKS
EXTRAS REFERENCES (if not included)
---
CONCEPT-FILES
IMAGE-IDEAS
SCRAPPED-IDEAS
---
Downloadable-WASPCOPTER
Downloadable
LeftOverJunks
---

and any or all of that is working with some miscellaneous details or programming between in case.
So we hit it up with the
TEMPLATE LAYOUT

and thats that basically. But intensively speaking we need to make sure the template layout also works as its own XSAP/XTAP/DEVICE/ASYLUM/MOUNT/IMAGE/MODICUM/NODE or anything that is integral to itself or independent in standalne including as a VPN/PROXY.
This is because of virtualized networking being affirmative/emphasized in the overall free-agency of the TEMPLATE LAYOUT-capabilities.
So it is really just --very capable on its own to set up it own networking/services if done correctly, and can detour/centralize its own infosec/opsec through its own "fully realized build" up to SuperCAMP.
In the effort of pioneering this independency, the sections also do well to advance themselves into a better performance/capability than its previous versions so long as they are all build with each other in mind.

--ANYWAYS--enough trying to embellish/emphasize a THEORETICAL-PROGRAM. Let's really exagerrate what it can do with this additional build-file
zz-04-Express-BootBackupMac

(Yes, its time to throw in some more crazy deductive reasoning/mockup-explanation)

Alot of things get done--and have been done.
We have discussed these more or less in sporadic/non-descript arrangement of other features etc. But these are keypoint features involved now in the Express-BOOTBACKUP I will try to correalate and organize.
In this approach we are going to focus on the various types of ESSENTIAL software that we can "bundle together to form this Express-BootBackup"
And it will be worth its own weight as I will explain why:

#1)
Firstly we have the QUANTUM PROFILE
@LINE 432 in 09-QuantumREADY-Computation-Profile 
This details a very extensive setup to allocating cluster/ranched probe/metric broker-data.
This will be combined with other factors in the Express-BootBackup.
(There are roughly 16 steps)

#2)
@ LINE 53 in 10-Applied-CounterSurface
This details the QUARTERING SEQUENCE
This will be useful in Express-BootBackup.
(There are roughly 14-25 steps)

#3)
@LINE 1220 03-XY-After-Rec-EndWorks-XX
THE DELTANOMIC DDAY SCENARIO (helps to detail a plan incase something goes wrong or an unrecoverable error takes place.
(There are roughly 25 steps)

#4)
Line 657 in 10-Applied-CounterSurface (YET AGAIN)
This details the subsystem arrangements. (there are 25 steps)

#5)
THE COLLECTIVE EXTRAS META FILES which are simply the titles involved in their setup.
There are roughly 13 steps + 3 more per Reference Item
So around 16 steps (just to assume we can build a "spoof engine if we need to"
This is important to distinguish models in QUASI-LEGACY Relations towards its final-builds.
And or helps to correalate a QUASI-MODICUM or its upgraded version as a SOLACE-DEVICE and Later an OUPHE-ASYLUM.

#6)
LINE 670 in zz-01-SiteDescription
This descrivbes the ENHANCED-BOOTMODEL-QUARTER
which already is a complex-macro/compact-script for checking BOOT-COMPATIBILITY
It is roughly 25 to even 28 steps.

#7)
Any of these steps can be developed into a VIRTUAL-DECK/LANE consisting of any amount of steps as well that are hybrid together for virtualization in whichever way works. This is also called the OUPHE-DECK.

#8)
THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF A MODULE is considered in being
1-A foundation/2-Main-ModuleBase/3-Any additional or adhoc to its Main-ModuleBase-Structure such as "a projector"
Which is basically 3 steps if it doesn't get complicated and have to also count its virtual-states/upgrades/targets/hosted-procs(i.e. cryptex brand) etc.

#9)
ANY TYPICAL AMOUNT OF MACRO/PROGRAMMING of the MACRO-AUTO-BUILDER. Which is more of a table of contents review.
This can also be upgraded to include ALL Table Of Contents within every file in this document, but its good enough as it is.

#10)
@Line 444 01-Starter-Surface-Distro
The programming in which may also correalate to the GYPPER and works with the DOORMAN(GYPPER)

#11)
@LINE 1415 01-Starter-Surface-Distro
A small Discussion of Various Mint-Product/Fuels.

#12)
LINE 2060 00-Deep-Core-Base-Repo
A REPURPOSED CHIPSET for the goal of incorporate the EXPRESS-BOOT-BACKUP and or OCR-for-OUPHE-SIGNATURES.

#13)
AUTOPILOT/SLEEPMODE as discussed in 01-Starter-Surface-Distro or anywhere else.

---managing this and packaging this in such a way to correalate a functioning OUPHE-TRAY for OUPHE-BUCKET screening allows to interject OUPHE-CODE and by golly that just sounds complicated so I sure hope everything works.
