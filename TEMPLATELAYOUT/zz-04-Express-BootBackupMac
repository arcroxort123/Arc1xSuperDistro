So now we have put together everything. And developed a SuperCamp and it all more or less works. We don't really have to think about anything but, we need to back up all the hard work we did.
Herein is a review of all that work and how to automate its REBUILD/RECOMPILE in case it ever needs to be repaired or reconsidered for alternative purposes/reasons in how or why it was built.


We Have Exclusively Worked our way up in this way:
Likely we have a 
---
LEGACY
VIRTUAL LEGACY
---
A full Text BUILD.
A full Advanced BUILDS
---
EXTRAS PERKS
EXTRAS REFERENCES (if not included)
---
CONCEPT-FILES
IMAGE-IDEAS
SCRAPPED-IDEAS
---
Downloadable-WASPCOPTER
Downloadable
LeftOverJunks
---

and any or all of that is working with some miscellaneous details or programming between in case.
So we hit it up with the
TEMPLATE LAYOUT

and thats that basically. But intensively speaking we need to make sure the template layout also works as its own XSAP/XTAP/DEVICE/ASYLUM/MOUNT/IMAGE/MODICUM/NODE or anything that is integral to itself or independent in standalne including as a VPN/PROXY.
This is because of virtualized networking being affirmative/emphasized in the overall free-agency of the TEMPLATE LAYOUT-capabilities.
So it is really just --very capable on its own to set up it own networking/services if done correctly, and can detour/centralize its own infosec/opsec through its own "fully realized build" up to SuperCAMP.
In the effort of pioneering this independency, the sections also do well to advance themselves into a better performance/capability than its previous versions so long as they are all build with each other in mind.

--ANYWAYS--enough trying to embellish/emphasize a THEORETICAL-PROGRAM. Let's really exagerrate what it can do with this additional build-file
zz-04-Express-BootBackupMac

(Yes, its time to throw in some more crazy deductive reasoning/mockup-explanation)
