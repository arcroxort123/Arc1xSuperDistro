This is a file to describe MEME math, a series of math that more or less makes no sense and does not need to be really used except for fun.
Things like COMMON-CORE is a meme-math.

Things like 2+2=6 ((two two's_ pairing issues) is a meme math.
things like  3+3 (three three's)
things like 2+2+2 (three twos)
wouldn't that make it (2+2+2)+(2+2+2) or something...idk its meme math and doesnt make sense. That's why.

A really weird way to build a capacitor which I probably described in a meme-math sort of way.
That it resembles a nursry rhyme song structure.
(This happens alot actually and with different rhymes/song structures so i keep it strictly to nursrey rhymes because its just that stupid)
