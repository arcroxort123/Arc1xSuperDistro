This is a file to describe MEME math, a series of math that more or less makes no sense and does not need to be really used except for fun.
Things like COMMON-CORE is a meme-math.

Things like 2+2=6 ((two two's_ pairing issues) is a meme math.
things like  3+3 (three three's)
things like 2+2+2 (three twos)
wouldn't that make it (2+2+2)+(2+2+2) or something...idk its meme math and doesnt make sense. That's why.

A really weird way to build a capacitor which I probably described in a meme-math sort of way.
That it resembles a nursry rhyme song structure.
(This happens alot actually and with different rhymes/song structures so i keep it strictly to nursrey rhymes because its just that stupid)

MEME MATH IS SUPPOSED TO BE UNNECESSARY MATH OPERATIONS, so there it is. If the document emphasizes meme math there is probably a better case/example in which it does not have to resort to MEME-math to explain.
I just use it as a massive excuse to "move the research along". But maybe it is important in one or two cases, therefore I am mentioning it here, meme math is really a concern for vulnerability/weakness of infrastructure/system-integrity, and should be approached with obvious caution to that fact. 
It should not really be messed with unless there is a fully secured/tested substitute/alternative. And MEME-MATH in different langauge sets can become siightly psyche-breaking. If not disrupt immersion/user-quality of life etc. Due to preferences/training.
So that is why I am slightly at ends/on edge/on the fence with using MEME-MATH (because maybe the systems I use need it)----things like DOCTORSUESS/WILLYWONKA...well thats an entire system of what meme math could look like. In quantum architecture, it can also get very "hollywood-syndrome'd". MEME-MATH is therefore a viral issue.
