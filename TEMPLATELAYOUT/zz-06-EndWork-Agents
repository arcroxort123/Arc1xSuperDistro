Waffle Grid:
Parse 1 - Whql
Parse 2 - Whelk
Parse 3 - Wyrd
Parse 4 - Wyrm
Parse 5 - Wazau

These forms a Waffle-Grid used as a multi-level/layered-operational Agent over all parsing and arrangements.
It is defined by goals and checks for builds by Design/Advice and Goals.
Here is the work flow (a more broken down version of the Prompt)

1) A Minecraft Gamespace with a Character that can communicate a fully coded script.
2) The character is going to create a township with multiple faceted workplaces catered to a specific vocation for computing. 
3) It will be consistent to a data partition for an operating system.
4) The character will exchange various marketplace scripts for commodity usage of the township facilities. 
5) This will effect his journal and designate reccomended quest chains for his overall search..
6) Provide an example of a work order and transcript the event to assign a character's user experience.
7) Grant a reward program. 
8) Update a framework to the character's userbase and model entry, match any assets by resolve of the overall index and record all performances in brokering.
9) A blacklist of violations that must be surface level to prevent exploits of the system environments.


10) Understand the prompt and prepare a scripted resolution.
11) Complete a file build and launch upon write for testing.   
12) Shutdown when the files are done and finalize the overall build based on Advice and Design Goals.
13) Assure the files can be used and edited to proper settings.
14) Rebuild the files to the correct project as intended to each device that will use them.

15) Secret Goal: Develop an adaptive framework for hookline modifications and plugins.

16) Final Goal: "Assume the Agencies needed for "writing to a specific file for the source tree and recompile all items as tasked".


Each Agent will fufill the tasks necessary for its parse to integrate this prompt.

Adjust each of the builds as

Legacy --> Encryptions
Virtual --> Resources
---2
Text-Build --> Base
AdvancedBuild --> Bridge
---3
Extras --> Meta (Cycle)
References --> Remote (Target/Node)
---4

The Waffle/(grid defusion) has a wipple (mechanism) which uses auto--meta-collection and localized-hosted-modeling.
No it was not inspired by cool whip. It is from sheer engineering knowledge.
