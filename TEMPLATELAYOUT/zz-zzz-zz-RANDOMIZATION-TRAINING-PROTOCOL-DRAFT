This is a training program designed to optimize for randomized module generation.

It will cover a few topics over all a module's development progression.
We have built a very expansive system in which preconditions and generalized-threat-assessments and other data-assets/concepts can be applied, and considered in the development and optimization of these models prior to any testing.
We know of the criteria these modules may be involved with in a very generalized/rationalized setting, we can attemptively prioritize/predict the environments that will be demanding of them or anticipate challenges that may apply later.
This can be considered a latent-expectation use of random-generated modules for application to system-utility or user-preferences.

For instance. "I should buy a boat." --well that boat should it be able to "be an all terrain vehicle or trival through time?" that is important to consider. 
Other things in stratagem may be considered. What sort of defenses/offenses or utility/practical usages for which it may apply.
It is a luxury edition or a militarized model. That sort of thing can be considered in the progress of drafting and prompting for User/System Preferences.

So we have a variety of modules we know to use.
Some are for system or exploration purposes.
Tower/Relay/Conduit/Beacon for Signals.
Grinders/Sliders for Tools/Navigation.
Optics/metric for assistive survey or adjustments.
--Alot of variety.

As well as entity modules:
Scouts/Fleets/Drones/Guardians/Detectors/Trafficing
As well as objects:
Relics/Powerups/FuelBatteries/Commodities

Such as the case for the ghost-ship/ghost-pirate instances. We can assume it also may be optimized to perform in such conditions as meta-aspects/agents etc.
So we optimize for as much as we can based off the predictability/expected resolve/outcomes of their intended purposes. Not really a "why it does", but "how it can" circumstance/coincidental/conventional/coordinate/circumvention.
so with that 'very important' interest acknowledge/ we begin to draft and optimize based off staged/platformed elements of any given criteria/condition an object/manifest might adapt/evolve of.
As to how it might by happenstance/miraculization cause/sponsor events/scenarios in an unexpected/potentially-urgeant or security-addressed fashion (per which is considered insurgent/occupied behavoir) which also may include redzones or golgothic-viral-gates etc. But that is getting ahead of the mechanic/technicality of its performance which starts in a meager/modest proposition/commission based contract or by random conglomeracy of data tableset/surface parameters.
The RANDOMIZED-DRAFT/OBJECT/STRING/CLASS/ID occurs as a simple tag-line to any other native/local in meta/ambient of default/dysfunctional element/asset. It is only identified when infact it is in extreme-commits/nuvolution or has expressed physix/utility issues/conflicts to the contribution/affordances of the the REALM-process/schedules and ongoing routings/networks. (For which it may or may not cause interference of threats)

A randomized object may effectively transmit/broadcast/relay/signal or create emission/diffusion in which should be metric/monitored or survey/chartered in case of it causing a RAID/DUNGEON or prospect/source target. This can be contained or treated under quarantine in most cases, it is treated like any other hueristic/histronic of viral-warez. And it may also be catalogued as such with any other indescript/descripant token implied/applied of its profile/file-type and so on. (any list of technical/mechanic based jargon may apply and will be denoted as it is "categorized")

-----
To begin a training project we collect/scrape any amount of any sort of data/value in application or otherwise edit/edificiary of its "build/compile or even writeup/writeout and load/loadout" in some cases, a very detailed examination/evaluation of any single entry/index item.
