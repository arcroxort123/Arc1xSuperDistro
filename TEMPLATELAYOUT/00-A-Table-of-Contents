00 PREP-SAFEPROTOCOL
--this represents the overall ideas in an exposed and non-secure setting (or minimally secure setup) as an IDEAFILE (this is the rawest ingrendients for cement)
00 ZPOST TEMPLATE LAYOUT BUILT
--involves a directory build/allocation or predetermined cache/bucket imprint of which (may be a touch/egg file) --(the cement gets mixed here)
01 SITEDESCRIPTION
--implies a server/hardware build or auto/virtual machine to handle the following  (sets for the corebuild components as well) --(the cement gets poured out)
02--AFTERMATH LOADOUT first legacy run 
--this allows for a FLOATPOINT/MANIFEST quantum-surface/automatic-mount/automatic-build based off a filetype host or command line read or just plain signaled as a source (bricks everything up/hardens the initial builds)
03 SUPERCAMP
this implies a tensor/hosting service to mount an image or be receptive to image-writes (allows the bricks to be "written out on")
----------(reinforces the write outs:)
04 EXPRESS BOOT BACKUPMAC
--This deals with mounting an image. (reinforces the write outs: with macs and posts)
05 BLACKLSIT PENALTY ACTIONS RELEASE
--This deals with Surface-EncryptionLevel-Access and Policy (the available options with use of an image) --(gets ready for additional protections/replacements to be made)
06 ENDWORK AGENTS
--This involves aforementioned knowledge of ENVIRONMENTAL-VARIABLES and counter-parameters that might stifle mount/installations --(starts color coding and poster boarding against system vulnerabilities/secure-points)
07 LIFEDEATH THEORETICAL MODEL
--this involves the IMAGE-USAGE from the MOUNT or directly --(starts targetpainting/surface-painting the knowns/unknowns of the range/tables overall)
08 SUPER BALLAST REVERANT BRIDGE
--this involves networking for imaging to be mounted remotely --(starts bringing in laser-guided/pulse projection of paints/writes)
09 Lightwave-INFERENCE-Model-Hypernet
--this involves NETWORK-STACKS to use images directly/remotely over a connection --(begins plastering up everything based off assisted drafts/plans)
10 BRAIN IN A BOX
--this involves the EMBED/WINDOW console usages from an image or also to host an PICTURE-IN-PICTURE simulation if necessary of that image ---(the machine is built and begins a safe-expansion/conversion of quantum-fields)

----(we begin code injection and native/local conversions through secured propogation/procedurated/progenerated/programmed emission/diffussion of origin/quantum-origin sourced data/energy)--(once this is done, we have also created a INTERACTIVE SINGULARITY and have MOBILIZED/INDEPENDENT PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVER-TRAY/REGIONAL-TABLE including vector/splices and ROAM/COUNTER-visory(manifold) --singularity containment and interactivity obtained (mobilized/connected)
zz--DockerFile---just a junkpile of programs to get things going (bloatware or maybe assistant usages)
zz--Mememath ---case examples of how code translates into other bloatware or assistant usages in language/peak settings
zz--noxinterface ---how code might mix things up for better or worse
zz--deweaponized quantum symbiotic toolkit autocannon ----automates all the code to at least a running capability
ZZ --randomization training protocol draft ---considers randomizing things until it basically optimizes itself (in a secured way)
zz--automodulebuild/autobuilder and (autoengine/boilerplating)----puts it all together in an independent system to form its own economical-progeneration of candlestick-data.
