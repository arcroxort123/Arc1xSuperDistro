This is to help anyone willing to go through all this ---some idea of what it really is and how to read through half this bs. I'm sorry, I am a person with terrible style and my organization skills are pretty obviously bad. This is the best I can do.

//1

We are building off a legacy/virtual baseline but it is not so important to bring it up (it gets brought up many times but largely it can just be sort of the booster seat in case we need one)

//2

In the Text Build - We set the grounds for a Node/Ai-Hosted Secure-Workspace.
This is helped with legacy hardware/software and approaches to build off a basic server/automated-ai-training.

//3

In the advanced build - We incorporate encryption methods and build blind-code which is more or less cryptography management and distribution of that over secure-data-exchanges (and its all basically done blind as its all password/transcoded "intensively")

//4

The Extras References seek to re-incorporate legacy hardware/software to accomadate the text/advanced builds with more options and ease of use. QOL/EOA (quality of life/ ease of access)---it does this for every possible extent/degree of security as well. It is a piece de resistance and it sure took alot of work. (It's also practically its own project on top of the previous)

//5

ConceptFiles are seemingly important side projects that also work their way into important tasks the system can also run.

//6

Image-ideas also works with Concept Files

//7

Downloadable offer an alternative program list that can be used (real programs by other people that you can use to build your own project---you dont need to take my advice--its just a bunch of stuff i managed to pick out ---for no real reason other than i could using my own internets to ---no i dont understand why)

//8

Downloadable Wasp Copter is a link to some assets I made in gpt that I am trying to get to example my main ideas. it does not include extra-perks assets unfortunately that would cost me more money to try to make happen and (like a week of slapboxing my shit in GPTE)---and its just boring and the assets are pretty much useless anyway.

//9

LeftoverJunks is really just ---more crap to ignore that I thought was worth noting but is actually worth really nothing.

//10

Template layout is a folder idea that just curates everything into the above as a single operation to be loaded out. This can occur as a profile to rebuild the system with itself IDK (like so many other things over too)--but I made it this way to grant---permissions where there might not be any. It is a massive band-aid basically. If that's not good enough I am sure you can go pay for it in Hollywood SFX or whatever, im just so tired.

//11

ScrapHeap/FatFile/ScratchUp is just everything dumped into one big file or at least tried to. its literally a bunch of crap words maybe it can be fed into an auto coder so i dont have to do anything.

//12

Others --this folder is not made because i dont feel putting up anything right now for it. but if i did, it would be here, such as all the unlisted works i have in my notebooks/sketchbooks which are just dumb ideas too. ALSO i might just build a system-snuffer that just disposes of system process and breaks it down back to nothing because (maybe I want to do that for some reason) like for fun. (maybe a good place to make the brain/snuff the brain/rng the brain/bot-net the brain
