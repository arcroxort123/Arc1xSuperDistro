How to perform the task of setting up a rail and prosper , to complete a dynamo module, and begin the legacy project. (In Minecraft)
---
To preface the jumpstart, we have to create an engine block of some sort. This can be done in a variety of ways, in real life, it can be a rotary engine/steam engine or general fuel assisted/injected engine or also magnetic powered engines and turbines. This follows the theory that it will only require so many base line parts to kick off.
So we develop an engine, and with that, we might as well get all other necessary components in order, much like a car, or factory machine, we will use other components to contrive power from the engine as needed. This includes the development of batteries and reactor power.
So we are going straight towards the goal of manufacturing batteries using a fob/fabrication center or marketplace and resourcing scrapyard etc.
We will then also establish a residency for our own shelter/survival and transportation as well as curator/assistant/mascot/agent automated services and staff(robotic).
This is the most important step to obtaining quantum-efficiency/productivity to utilize all supporting-vocations and environmental-benefits possible in an expeditionary camp.
Ultimately we will be attempting to accelerate tidal-power/gravity and other quantum-mechanins to quickly obtain resources quickly and expedite their production and refinment.
---sometimes through particle manipulation and teleportation and of course computers etc.

PHASE 1- the rail: (MAIN AUXILLIARY)
First off, in Minecraft we are technically in a stoneage, we need to begin to smelt iron, and develop circuits capable of computing/automation. But to do that, we need to technically develop a home/farmstead.
The situation is evident that this will require a power system, so we can also immediately prepare for those systems, as well the benefits that come with those.
The first real module to be built is a weather-station.
----
We will also develop a junkyard for scraping items (in theory).
It will track accepetable times which to generate power/scrap-items in which to process/reprocess through sorting them in a recycling plant.
We will produce metal plates used for reactor/thermal energy, and attempt to crystallize refuse/excess/trash/resources into battery components and metals.
There is also a quality control station for junking and catalogueing these items (as a client/meta-stat---a precursor to the metaserver)
----
This will develop into a marketplace where the process may be "benchmarked".
And we can begin to supply a robotics-fabrication-plant to further help automate this process.
----
Later it will become a navigation center/training center acting as a remote/meta server.
From here we will deploy a production chain and delivery system over analog robotic postkeeping.
This is also a cutoff point between our base of operations and remote distances which are parsed as needed, this parse is called he guassian-border.
----
-=--
----
With that process kickstarted, we will use our robotic expedition system to develop a means of long-range travel (often through fleet or vehicular exploration and scouting)
We will also develop residencies for which to house trained units and manufactured storages for our products, in which to stockpile and maintain overtime through scheduling and so on. A robotic colony if you will.
This is overseered through the nexus-server, which is a massive computer/technician center that handles data that has been assembled/collected through our own catalogue/processings and informations provided by our workforce/staff.
This is handled from the analog of the  gaussian rail, which connects between the residencies/fleet-yard to the nexus server.
----
The nexus server eventually gets upgraded as an abs-lab/central-core-stem-framework(housing all the shells/ram of the bs)/the connected gpu center and network center and scanning center/the calculator and periphereal tray)
-----and is later upgraded with a meta-header for output-data-product and encoded-objected(files/itemizations)---the meta header also can receive projection-data and hologram data and function as a test-environment.
Then from that there is a viral-quarantine and security-testing-center, as well as a quality emissions-check-station
It is then packaged/transferred to a logistics chain and accelerator---which acts as a direct router to a business district---
----
----
----
The business district performs a contracting/release agency for which the products are distributed outside the system, it also secures them with licensings/credentials in security and encryption.
Then it is passed to a logic-gate/lounge/lobby/demo-lab for world servos (interaction) ----THIS COMPLETES THE DISTRIBUTION/AUTOMATION CHAIN
----
----
There is also a viral processing center
and advanced resourcing center which is the upgrade of the first distribution/automation chain
As well as a subtraction-rail which expedites the collective/manufacture quality check and emissions-tests over a fast-pace transfer-lane/deck. This consists of article/product analysis and contracting fulton products (in expedition)
----
----
This connects to another analog, this analog houses drones/power centers which produce the "delivery vehicles in automated/fashion)---this is where our reactors/dynamo is located as well and is secured.
The opsec that connects is the  final quality-check of all automated goods/processes that oversees the entire RAIL, for what we have established that to be.


PHASE-2-The prosper: (SUPER TURBINE)
We have completed the rail and begin to use it to connect to a remote-launch-site
Everything is rebuilt now in an automated fashion, and compacted and automated as an optimized data-farm. It will scrap and gather advanced resources as well as enable additional luxury/quality of life services such as a med/pharm/nusery/infocenter and researchlab/biolab.
We will establish a super market with its own board system
And nearby a launchsite with a full service-table(all services/vocational providences are enabled and interactive)--so the launchsite can order from the market and the standard rail catalogue.
---
Following that there is a traffice-center that handles long-range/warp-lines
As well as a beacon device that signals transmissions from broadcast points along the rail and prosper as well as a regional pulsuary that opsec can decode.
---
There is a "schedule/routine training/life-cycle and moonbase vehicle plant"---that designs rockets/capsules for expeditions.
---
Later there is a massive battery-turret defense system
And a recreational projector for holographics/hologram injection or data-production for technical usage.
A convention center and message board for housing and deciphering holographic-data and later on/ a blacksite arena that may house a blackbox/boltzman-brain.

THE LEGACY JUMPSTART BEGINS (we refine everything to convert a dynamo into a bouquet):

Phase3 the F-Reality/VirtualFlagship
---We develop our accelerators using the beacon/asylum and meta-header/nexus to generate a hyperthread-actuation system for hyperdrives and warplanes are achieve.
---We redevelop the nexus into a lotus system, that has a navigational-module known as a quantum bouquet (similar to the hyper-drive towers)
---This allows for zerospace jump-drives or mass-transportation and advanced-data-management.
---We virtualize our entire system in a programmable simulation and generate a world-shield, and establish full-regional realm-holography.
---We fortify this through arc-welds and emp-ablative technology to protect and defense/offense protocols with physical-warfronts/crypto-warfronts.
---The virtual legacy develops a broadcast system to which can host simulations/ai-testing. We can begin designing gamespaces using "ai-automation and things like advanced stable-diffusion"

Phase 4---the text builds---we create a dyson/turing engine
Phase 5---the advanced builds we create a quantum-automation-system that decodes blacksite data and expedites distribution of refined code-states.
Phase6---the META-EXTRAS includes a SUPPORT system of the entire Virtual-Flagship, we build a physical flagship
Phase 7 - with the META REFERENCES  we begin working with ai-robotic/cybernetic entities to assist the overall needs and stability through quantum-sciences
phase 8 ---Concepts and Ideas ---we discuss additional modules previously withheld/postponed to due quantum-demand/capabilities.
PHASE 9 ---Template LAYOUT we begin discussing theory-crafting and EXPANSIONS to the systems and the use of ADVANCED-CYBERNETICS and AI-SERVICES
phase 10---We develop an ARCHON-LOIC and Leviathan System
