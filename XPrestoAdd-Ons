Developed a time-manager and data-transfer expediter. (Unfortunately it was based on shamcode)
Developed a Spi-Dider Lair which functions with a automatic-toolkit/pruning debugging (How counter-intuitive for a bug-zone)
These work with the Distro System assumably.
Some of its coded some of if isn't. Can drop a large Junk file for that. (Will be using AiTokens to code it for me so its already technically 'made to be recoded'.
