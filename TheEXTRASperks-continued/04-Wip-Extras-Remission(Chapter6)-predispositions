4/6/2024 revisiting:
4/15/2021
pic of the data-routing-assembly (and its orientation slightly modulated to a grid quadrant)--to assist as a dispersion-of its original data routing (helps to accelerate constraints in its regulation)--this techniqie is implied useful its referred to as (dispersion.distortion)--it essentially preps a non-dithered data set for dithering/splitting over (double lensing)
i can off brand the new power plan into a working process for the triggerquads
run off trigger base and husk trigger (exchangable) and then oldlocking usage with amorphism
then use them as powerlines for circumventuring (very crude powerline-powershell)
its experimental but it is also "workably encodable" ---its not experimental after how far other experimentals have gone in comparison, this is child's play for code-idiots (and somehow i have the morals to continue this)
for abstracting plans
then i can write in memory schematics hopefully with abstract schemes (I THINK I AM BEGINNING TO design an AWS layout)--so if you use AWS just use that for most of this and further (as well as prior builds)--alot of it can just be written by AWS-profiles ---(BUT I DONT HAVE THAT SO I HAVE TO GO THRU IT THE LONG WAY)--(i also at the time...have no idea how long that way is or if i will come out of it unscathed)
using data forwarding possible as an enhanced form of text forwarding --(well here is a forward...lets use everything we have so far..summarize it all again for the 100th time, its good to go, ground to control initiate:is my prothesis)---IF THE BROKERING IS TAKING PLACE (and likely is....we are doing ok)--if it needs to be auto-gpt'd or whatever ,it probably will work out later anyway. (Doing good so far this revisit)
it appears on the truncation tables --(doing good so far..i just keep telling myself that----I FEEL LIKE A ROADKILL PAVED ROAD TBH)
this blaances out xcursia-contiguity and also deadlock or extinction rates
via stents and use of interpolating ---(BY THE WAY---the kick off is that we are actually rebuilding this as with NOX-compatibility such that we can afford the pipelines we talked about, so they work, so they will auto place when we blow this all up into the correct position/build)---(we are essentially "doing the roundabout and closing the loop as it were, from the backends of everything)
by the 5th trainer of the truncation table or earlier ---(what i am also saying is...we are on the RETURN TRIP of the project, having a touched-point-nox-origin---we are making our way back knowing the long road we used to get there, we are coming back from that, typically--we are on backtracking/backstepping/backdrifting/back-checking everything as we are building-our-way-back and into a fully-reversed-distrubtion)
allowing the last two to fletch sucessively via their alternative write ups of als and logiram----(what this also means...is that the DETAILS THEN may not matter so much as new details NOW have been developed/innovated---but that in either case, sometimes those details may work very well together. And sometimes, create brand new details out of that, or that there are marginal elements that build up to a better-system)
write ups are used for the base of the truncation tables as well (oldlocking/isolated splicing)---(WITH THAT IN MIND, we might have a MIX-MATCHED system in which several parts are scrambled into a big working-device for later)--such as the DIFFUSER coming together and the NOX-PRINCIPALIS/IONIC-noxQUO and its decryption methods etc. (This might end up being something else we will call up later, i just don't know yet)
or (oldbase encoding/primo encoding ---logirithmic iterating / ghost processing)---(NOW ALSO--we have an idea of what we are already doing, and what might work with legacy codes/methods etc, but for now we are just cruising along, with some things matching up here and there, nothing is really intended or planned out, so keep an open-awareness towards things that might suddenly click or fit into place-thats prettymuch it)

they formulate as a draft write up (that is datapermissable)
and then can be forwarded as data write ups
using a secondary protocol that is known for (compression or primal compression)
fits in line with the peacebust system that we have been using with the husk line and proxy
so that it can bactivated or "suspended" for priorty usage
it also has a processing drawback that can be queued for mitigated powerloads "silent mode
and can be compatibility checked for stem usage
for dual monitor usage as well that also works with a unified-rss correction (uniform dresscode)
bottling necking bugplate

this mid line we can call a whole week, and to the left a week and to the right a week (3 weeks)
extras were of course then an extra week ( a month)
then that's a month and finalizes of them a month
this took 2 months really 3 months due to other projects being shelved on the side

automate an image docking to occur a system render to change or adapt without interruption
for later deocing it can save anamalous imaging states
which it reintegrates into an rss render (for the monitor)
it can attempt to perform a refresh framrate as well (onboard render refresh)
or a snapfile frame or scenario refresh (or degaussing)
more or less a normal save state
also known as flash booting
--Mango Drink Vendor (Vendor Machine) this is the drink on the BUSINESS DISTRICT TOWER/ also (the drink ideas are coming to nexus!)--(there is a 2nd drink vendor compared to the business tower/logic gate)--i thought it might as well
Original/Tropical (im being sarcastic)---(they are the same flavor)--probably...idk

Considered Fully Upgraded with Drafting Check System 4/15/21 (the nexus--tho i havent mentioned every sign on it)
This is not Deployed but it can be outposted (considered without explanation)---which is more or less worth it if you want to run "pong" or an atari that will crash constantly/and actually doesnt work unless GPT or something helps me
Due to 4/12/31 this can be image docked into draft check system.
4/12/21 minicane also considered for MEMcane (a process i dont think i expounded on due to MEMETICS and memory being complicated AsFK)---i mean it can work if you wanna play dumb (but i wanted my memory to be the most complicated!)
Can Deploy polyCane (command cores) 4/15/21 (debatable since i wasn't considered memory-compression being an issue as much then)-(its such an issue now that i have to incorporate EVEN MORE than just novel ideas into it, i have to make them adaptive for different states/phases/compressions/datarates ETC)--holyhell
MINICANE 1 2 3 4 is the systems for proxy too, as well as abs, as well as minicane itself (to help corral and orientate DATA-THREADS from DATA-STRINGS and data-bytes and file-types in RAM or on PROC)---let's just believe it works even just a little bit ---its like having an AUTOMATIC-SHOESTRING-TYING-MACHINE
Our a multi-cane pack (wishful thinking at its hardest extract imaginable)
this can be coupled with t-sec capsules
for quick-checks (as in, if it dont work it broke if it do i guess nope-broke it workie-do)
can deploy as an optimized pak for quick-fix or snap-tos (wishful thinking)
requires compatbility check with secure pass 
these are code handles that are time senstive used on RSSpane (it shows up as errors logs or problem fixes etc and maps out hopefully over the "task-viewer")
basically the wireless padlock
minicanes for superaux is (not the norm) called a flex rig ---(but many types of "flexing/edging" is the norm somewhat...if it makes it work then its the NORM!)
and is considered temporary --(there must be like 50 different flexie/edgie chippy-choppy adjustments in here that are supposed to work and are all just theory)--one day i will list them all--for now they are subprocesses for each submodule that basically "flips apple turnovers into basket-code" with its own style.
(this is exclusive to minecraft build resources) due to redstone (wanting to use surface-codes on a voxel printed object to make it look like it performs to a circuit specified function/application) like a redstone circuit. is why im saying its exclusive (it really isnt)--but it might be best kept that way for now.
this can be considered a temporary excursia table (a task-manager i guess with all its hashing)
but just as a sub/stub (a thing that is not necessary)
(ALSO it will be likely set to a brokering service later--so the broker can broker the system;while it brokers its system without having to network its brokering)

Trying to at least make a targeting system:
Mini-Tag/Mini-Shots 
Please Keep G-rated
A thoughtful pump design (not serious)

Emergency Exhaust
put these where ever there is pressure zones just for safety
I made one back at spawn at the start
(A lightning rod) second time installed as well
Conveyed Power Grid for Power USAGE
Hydrostation
Waterwheel (for inalnd streams)/ NOT FOR DRINKING
Windmill for wind energy /harnessing *(obvious)
its this easy to make windmill for power
Solar Panels (pa connected for fun)--also a funny idea here---cymaticSolarPanel-readouts/metric (i can tell how much power i have by sound output of its intake)---actually this idea is kinda dumb but maybe not for showboating
Tidal Energy
6 totalenergy sources here
this charges a battery for night usage etc.
GIANT BATTERY in safety case in its FuelCart with a MAGHANDLE (a quadbattery for each source i can fit on it)
The maghandle tracks power reserves with RSS panels too.
and can interface for remote diagnostic
(The maghandle shows which source is color coded as what)
power meter

these extra proxy edge work and battery placements are the kitNkaboodle
battery power can also extend power reserve reach
or effectivity and lower draw rate
to keep systems nominal they can be optimized via CanePacks
hipegi base boards can be battery sustained now along with admin access for optimization
this helps to perform remot snapto's
in the adjustment of routine and traffic control
allowing for faster render checks
that way a full circuit can be forwarded
security may become heignted during full circuit forwarding
Cmos Text Forwarding Dianogstics Inserts
(coldfusion battery cell much much much much much later)----but for now its a regular cmos with a temparture cooling pad on it --(this is a super big secret im sharing your welcome---it was also discovered by sheer luck/chance/fluke/mistake even)--still currently waiting to see the results of this later 4/6/2024
this is for a huge tripcode to use with the optimum flex-rig
and the battery keeps it connected thru extending range of domain
and does a full circuit forward where necessary to maintain upkeeps at minimal costs
through a phase 4 draft-boarding of the stem it can be considered a mini-off-site device
so an aux basically has full domain of its assisted core packs while in operation OFFSITE
so our own baseline assists them directly despite being long range
and can multi-pack with several installations as if directed (using the QUAD-TENSOR/Terraflopy and or VHMIMG teraflopy it can be quite a good hash)
via a network it can also be able to supportt with effectivity rates  bolstering offsite locale
so a prim bonus is considered for its dispatch (just wait until PRIMARCHS start happening then this bonus is just even more)
this occurs all under secured conscription
so i can have them interface compatibility and comply with the rss commands
which allow for a more thougouh overhaul of the offsite conditions
can adjust system to operate different under altnernative composition of ALS and LogiSet
to appear as seperate systems
this a very imporatnt truncation tables so that they are placed into correct licenseships
this helps for better ifnrastructure during aggregation and conglomeracy
otherwise known as condensed or open complexing (which is what the nox tables are going to do which i have to mention now)
and performs under correct draft commands of their system state
