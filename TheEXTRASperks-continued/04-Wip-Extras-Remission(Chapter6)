4/6/2024 revisiting:
4/15/2021
pic of the data-routing-assembly (and its orientation slightly modulated to a grid quadrant)--to assist as a dispersion-of its original data routing (helps to accelerate constraints in its regulation)--this techniqie is implied useful its referred to as (dispersion.distortion)--it essentially preps a non-dithered data set for dithering/splitting over (double lensing)
i can off brand the new power plan into a working process for the triggerquads
run off trigger base and husk trigger (exchangable) and then oldlocking usage with amorphism
then use them as powerlines for circumventuring (very crude powerline-powershell)
its experimental but it is also "workably encodable" ---its not experimental after how far other experimentals have gone in comparison, this is child's play for code-idiots (and somehow i have the morals to continue this)
for abstracting plans
then i can write in memory schematics hopefully with abstract schemes (I THINK I AM BEGINNING TO design an AWS layout)--so if you use AWS just use that for most of this and further (as well as prior builds)--alot of it can just be written by AWS-profiles ---(BUT I DONT HAVE THAT SO I HAVE TO GO THRU IT THE LONG WAY)--(i also at the time...have no idea how long that way is or if i will come out of it unscathed)
using data forwarding possible as an enhanced form of text forwarding --(well here is a forward...lets use everything we have so far..summarize it all again for the 100th time, its good to go, ground to control initiate:is my prothesis)---IF THE BROKERING IS TAKING PLACE (and likely is....we are doing ok)--if it needs to be auto-gpt'd or whatever ,it probably will work out later anyway. (Doing good so far this revisit)
it appears on the truncation tables --(doing good so far..i just keep telling myself that----I FEEL LIKE A ROADKILL PAVED ROAD TBH)
this blaances out xcursia-contiguity and also deadlock or extinction rates
via stents and use of interpolating ---(BY THE WAY---the kick off is that we are actually rebuilding this as with NOX-compatibility such that we can afford the pipelines we talked about, so they work, so they will auto place when we blow this all up into the correct position/build)---(we are essentially "doing the roundabout and closing the loop as it were, from the backends of everything)
by the 5th trainer of the truncation table or earlier ---(what i am also saying is...we are on the RETURN TRIP of the project, having a touched-point-nox-origin---we are making our way back knowing the long road we used to get there, we are coming back from that, typically--we are on backtracking/backstepping/backdrifting/back-checking everything as we are building-our-way-back and into a fully-reversed-distrubtion)
allowing the last two to fletch sucessively via their alternative write ups of als and logiram----(what this also means...is that the DETAILS THEN may not matter so much as new details NOW have been developed/innovated---but that in either case, sometimes those details may work very well together. And sometimes, create brand new details out of that, or that there are marginal elements that build up to a better-system)
write ups are used for the base of the truncation tables as well (oldlocking/isolated splicing)---(WITH THAT IN MIND, we might have a MIX-MATCHED system in which several parts are scrambled into a big working-device for later)--such as the DIFFUSER coming together and the NOX-PRINCIPALIS/IONIC-noxQUO and its decryption methods etc. (This might end up being something else we will call up later, i just don't know yet)
or (oldbase encoding/primo encoding ---logirithmic iterating / ghost processing)---(NOW ALSO--we have an idea of what we are already doing, and what might work with legacy codes/methods etc, but for now we are just cruising along, with some things matching up here and there, nothing is really intended or planned out, so keep an open-awareness towards things that might suddenly click or fit into place-thats prettymuch it)
