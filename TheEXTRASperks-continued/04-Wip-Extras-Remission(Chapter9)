04-Wip-Extras-Remission(Chapter9)

the issue was given a brek and later was discovered of the aether forge and kaeledoscope
will be also give into a power shell generator known as they shield battery
the shield battery is a portable shield which effects aether armoring via a new set of builds
thankfully its not as complicated to make and can likely be done in one building
that building used relies on the displacer spacing (tableture space for embrasure modules)
the embrasure is fit with a conversion (for grease databit) that is the first or 2nd step
it forms the lattice fitting (of the lattice autobolster-mixmax addon of the lattice) extension
that is probably the third part
the fourth part is a dual binuaral hammer relay
the hammer is used to form a bridged connection over the flex gearing (flex suit assistances)
and then the fourth part of the embrasure is likely the battery creating a solid index of 5
it essentially MEANS that warez can be converted using shield boosting so absorbtions work
this can be used to transmit power repairs and wireless replenishment (more than likely)
requiring of the kaeleidoram and the aether forge now the also (gene lab + anamolyzone)
this forms a fifth piece of that mixture unless i am missing something and this is the product
of some other 5 piece arrangement where this arrangement is the product of 5 pieces in 5+1
top illustrate that would loook as a stripped module where its been bolstered and recomposited
so the bearing module of its ampuled domicile is squared correctly to provide an injection
that occur synonymous with any receptacle inlcude the thermal reactor symbiote receptacle
so while any module can be placed a coupling the better coupling is the shielded model
this allows for better pormpting and vocoding
which helps to correeealtes with system capacities of xprocs
system acapcities of xprocs the system can then plan to allow for xproc maximal throughout
so the kaeldiram+aetherforge +(couples with crownmosiac + grease bit+ iprs) 1234 (bolstered)
the bolster can be metered and mufflered for quiet embrasure status
and then the additional star vault can be used with alongisde the model system of shield vocodes
the powered 5 stated module i.e. as starshielding (or aether shielding relies on displacers)--(starvault) to space
in that the whole module displaces itself of course due ot the bolsters it can be adjusted
so the star shielding may be temporary, due to flux conversions (however this can be modulated)
its very powerful shielding however and does so portably so the battery is used as well
using the bolsters as a building (refinment instead of their own building) it fits the model 5+1
and its a major deal to nail down if you dont have each of their installments backed up too
each installment consists of 5 pieces at least i dont want get into it we have them already
--
the battery is used to convert displaced settings to reclaibrate and reconfigure correction
this completely eliminates corruption threats by WAREZ/Anamolies and can requisite captures
the captures can re-analysis and decrypt any warez to salvage or preuposed use (power)
--
it literally can eat any data it doesnt need (if its not overtly corrupt by the event of using)
datamining/datahauling will only function to support further (in lieu of work contract order)
bear in mind the settings can be readjusted for the specifications of the overall production
and output or efficiency is wildly experimental or what would be considered fringe stability
this is what is known as a full prosper perk system
in which case the soldier model with its armor and flexing apparatuses may use shielding too
making it excel over standard titan rigging
--
Microwave sterilizations Containment Decontamination/ Potential Slege Works (Sluice+Salvage)--lol sluicide
basically as a joke i call it the cow-reail with its crib+caretaker+itscowpower and cowpasture (cowfarming)
there is also a coral-farm for (ocean farming) maybe
that is the cow+medline and microwave + forest
if it goes further i guess it goes to try to get it some from the forge but it goes to jailholds
that is the big bait as they call it
--
meanwhile it is put to work then and works making tool crafts for me
which help to support it being what it is it is made to support itself and be a market workslave
it also gets assistances with being a market-workslave from campworking for farms/minerals
this is supported with being a place for it as the CAMP RAIL so the CowCamping is what i call it
as the specialized job set each vocation has its forms of cow camping
such like the cow camping symbolizes an LMG or an outfitted tank of itself (a working machine)
maximizing a shard emplacement as a tank outfit that is modulated as a nuclear launch device
via academia + intrinsica (sacrement too)
the tank can be used as a loic station

brings new meaning to the phrase i loic it, i loic it alot (i hate my life acutally and i hate having to do this so much that cheesy humor is my only outlet from this misery)
automatons can be equipped with an iprs and loic cannon for suppressive broadcast of forts
and can easily take down other fortresses
hazard zones espeically a loic automaton is preferred for siege while iprs destabilizes shield
both diminish the severity of a blue haven outbreak incredibly well
allowing for fortress conversion and as well recoupling of necessary provisions or munitions
able to enclose solid defensive perimeters through automated laser grids made impenetrable
it will not even percieve the threat of a full siege surrounding unless a full system breach
which it will completely detect prior to any real risk
in a non blue haven setting it can initialize itself as a blue haven fortress
in a blue haven setting well it obviously doesnt have to since that is its level of operation
it may also allow for the commanding arrival of full battleship fleets which it can support
and also deploy full use of automated spider mines
such that they cannot be converted or likely will not be converted in mass due to detections
the spiders can also be used to convert any other competing encroachment it encounters
-
keliedoram is basically half of what the-aether(there-after) forge is supposed to be (full spec to half spec)
this later allows for hybrid multispec patternizations

being harassed
so i rep about 30 pounds 300 times or so
and another so they can just f-off and f-ing leave me alone

finished a building and its roof that was taking a long time

initilize spider mine and deployed proxy missiles (had enough of harassement and bolstering defenses) iron-dome style
Kaeleidoaram completed (or wahtever) (a series of buildings)

they will definitely learn to f-off and leave me alone now (pro tip they dont and never learn)


9/16/2021
at least i have built something in less than a week or so i guess
--
temporal facueting is achieved if the automatons are allowed to drill in their stations (stat-field drill)
via use of s8 casing and packages manifolds (--this gets more complex with advancements in nox)
it can be considered a full function system with the closing of the open frame (but it should +4)
the automation can just use shield so it doesnt matter though
this uses adjustable antipodding as a bench beacon along the entire rail adjusting contiguity
this forms timeshare usage for our premium accounts but only in limited access
this is once again proven important as cybernetic power biorelays must preserve energy
via cyto-genic infusion of the biolattice, the cybernetic relays can also outperform their cost
cytogenic stages occur only through homunculus regenerative gateway conversions
so having them "domesticated in such a way" the training costs are lowered and managable
the antipodding relay of the entire bench line helps provide energy assurances in case of
---is basically my first RELEIF/RESERVE/RESTORATIVE/RESORT system---which has been almost impossible to get to this point but its there now (So damn right its premium only, i can finally try to catch my breath and move on)
basically for diamondback tanking systems (such as a hovertank)
preferabbly in order to conserve power the battery clipping occurs for easy transports (at least, easier navigation so to speak)
they carry through station to station using patroled routine in power management and parks
evidenced in their "roam capacity" which is used to limit or control power stores and traffic
carry capacity of the rail dpends on unit management that does not overburden reserves
the point where automaton fortressing generates enough power reserve for max population
everything can also be in a compact state where the rig is condensed into shard usage only
1 shard is basically 1 very packed fortress of a full capable system
it is preferred that the rig be devoted (or dedicated) to certain rig states using multistates
multistate rigging therefore implies more than one compact shard (like a fob system)
the work lighting of the orange original emplacements are signified capable of power demands
the fob shard signifier means that shard is at maxiumum energy load for its shard state use
many fobs using maximum power-details implies a deep state of region control that stacks out
so a working shard will produce all goods and services the 2nd may provide for unitary cost
1 2 and the third would obviously be used as some other service such as would a fob system
notably iprs systems or "far reaching providence" allows for better logistic transport loads
123 sort of work to srpead their entire domain to maximum productibility
4 would be to assist in compu-technicalities and timeshares of power procs
123+1 (4) so 5 would be to support the maximization to the quarter w/boosted flex shielding
this is known as a supershard block
--
though its been covered before that is generally the acceptable building set of the installation
other uses may include a ship station or largescale iprs setting used as Fortressing the RIG
by stage 6 thereis generally no power issues left that have no been resolved.
seeing as that each shard state can multi-purpose themselves to suit priorities of others
a resourcing shard strictly for bolstering resources can be used as well (7)
this is to insure the quality control of resources is fully operational to the power demands
stage 8 would be equivilency of a blue-haven shard fortress used for expeditionary utensils
this would for an adhoc aggregational model supershard (complete with server networking)
and would fill the entire case-provision of the domain several times over the original intents
by stage 8 it would be considered for data productivity and actuated data mining (autocrafT)
this can be condensed to hotkey usages in which there is retainable functions to standards
and would overlay with other "iprs and datamining systems " in order to enhance power draws
this would form a module under the last module as a hybrid double module
such that it could interface with powershielding couplings and form to the bench lotus nodes
thru use of a cybernetic or cetogenic relay system in the rigging structure 'in console mode'
known for itself incorporating under the 25 embrasure placement of the 10-(2)+4(as a xPLc or xPLX or plcX)
basically like having a telescopic electron-micro-scopic kaelido+ram
which pump out particles
in a way they are used via a chemical planting or otherwise (other purposes)
autofarm+automining+autopumping+sledge+repositoryLAB system as well (for assisted tech)
is 5+5
the nursery stting system or the aeon-holding (for ship carriages) might as well be 5
that is ahead of this location at the moment
"it lierally makes nectar a thing that would not work in this system if we didnt have it"
the launch site which is basically a big system of 5 things (so we are at 20)
and the advancing rialing integrations with that (using crown mosiacs and world building items)
makes for 25 with the ulimated cybernetic accelerator or X-PLC (which i will makealso work with a biolab later, and that will be a chore to write out)
will double back on most of the issues as a coupling system to the first power relays
so the high bar reactor (and it is a HIGHBAR reactior double core dynamo turing engine)
connects to this 25+1 XPLC "outsourcable data mining semi-shard/prosperRAIL" aka p-RACK
so the pRACK connects to the p-REACTOR
which basically counts as somewhat of its own shard or mini-shard
with the rest of the components it will meet shard level stanards hwoever it is specialized to
a pRACK+pReactor is going to simply make or be able to make anything without any problem still
so having connected to the shelf wil simply allow it more versatility as a SuperServer/Shard
1 2 3
the fourth would be that is performs as a ShardModel that also specializes with the AutoPrint
allowing for consistent and full-time circuit based actuated production  based off system use
1 123+(1) quarter in order to faciliate the necessary requiremetns of massproduction ABS
each 123)+1) canm then have an intefaceable abs in order to correalate with the original ABS
this allows fo the extra or exotic ABS to finalize and also correalate to a double-purposing
which already in having of metioning had no dual purpose other than being emplaced in case
the dual purpose can also help to situate for dual mounting of server racks as a NPT-Block
---
such the server itself under this orientation is completely functionable without extra-assists
rendering needs for any amount of other serve usage aside from the original base counts
the 8 (+1 to the effet an extra shard) will completely accelerate as a main standalone mode
the standalone x-render can also be simply be used as a single server rail+full rig anyway
and can be set to a dual purpose actuated funciton of the direct x-rpocing to occur course
the server main funciton and the actuated funciton of the render serivce that is providable
this allows for a full automated server to maximum 100% capability of working and processing
but relies on a preprogramming scheduling under the operating systems required in real time
the real time can be alleviated to productability enhancements of the other 8 ((base models))
such that the acutation is not necessary and can be modulated to work in ebtween requisites
dealing it would be prefrrable to have the full x-render with an original dual-server shard
so it can work throughout having any set up of 1-8 where +1 is being alleviated to xprocs
to reduce or "completely remove the need for automated real time" non-inteferenced use
---
it requires a server status that is adhoced
so it is only best to adhoc with another fully cpable system
the other issue is that once adhoced in anyway it greatly increases output for other modes
so 1+1 all the way to 8+1 is likely less strenueous in the need of building materials
and just can be automated up to that point of having the entire setting such it Automaximizes
therfore the system is cohnsidered in some cases a x8 servershard shelf of 1mount
so point being the plc is barely noticable in its deliverances and the wait limits are diminished
that once the AutoMaximation of x8+1 is prepared it can swtich to x16(PLC) mode to having xPLC
this would appear as the base model supershard + a secondary base model super shard for
4+1 plus specialized 4_1 the 10set
the 10set supershard therefore is near synonymous with the original 10+shard layout
the secondary usage of that having shard be a dual purposed shard that specialized or not
is that the coring selection can be altered
--
that the coring selection can be altered such that in an isometric cubic setting(vox-kernal)
its output can be considered quadcore such that quadratics can be shouldered

*harassment continues for over a few hours

and it would become a fully quadratic capable single/supershard (if the vox-kernal is used)
give the appearence of a x32 level supershard
as a server the supershard/superserver would be x64 (requiring at least one vox kernal)
two vox kernals to a super server would mostly allow for x86 usage
point being that the entire databit processing would occur at a very complex staging
nitros nuance of that would just be very capble of supportin the power requirements of
this would occur through antipodal - bridging of the xplc of the x32 x64 x86 models in modes

*more harassment

place the xplc osiris chip here i guess (at meta server 1st parse before market)
somewhere tho
maybe we adhoc to it
it could be helpful for steering mechanics for it to synch correctly to the wheel
and can be motorized of course
and greatly help with manifold fuel (coaxials)
it can be used to track the coordination of the xpail (xbucket x basket)
this would be used as the x-faucet
this can be used to adjust totemic positioning
by realigning normals
this grounds out 6.53gigabyte in the process

currently at 1.8 megatons of detail (exagerrating obviously but i think it should be that)
economical allowance disables some of the excess that is with security turrets
and with a simple drilling rig get to 60% capacity of which 20% remains with fuel and food costs
the costs are for fuel food, product tools, and generally everything else

more like a 5% remainder after payments ammirite lol bu for real all is there for my rig now
after one mining trip

the mining trip was basically one horizone worth of mining dep core mining through
we built this twice over anyway
and we used the first one obviously
just having had done it twice means output should be 2x
everything is twice over
so obviously the mosiac crown and genetics lab are functioning on their own tier bases
each forming a tsecitoned wedge shielding
after many many arrangements this can also be straightened
with the water table adn the chance also for ... a antipodal branch (doubtful) looks very pogo
maybe even sai that paid twice but not as much as an entire rigs worth
anywho this allows passage into lost realm eventually via dark-isometria gatepathing
where we can harvest mementia if thats even important (it simply just allows to fuel artifacts)
but the rig can already capture and use artifacts through data mining devices and assembly
turnign their warez into fuel base for nitros-nuance (i guess we would have a nitrous well)
that relies on fossilized components we reconstructed of artifactsknown as the architecture
so we have just make an artificial nitrous artifact from this rgi basically
that is bench on a contiguity chain from the x-plc superserver x86 shard system
--
that is basically just as much one of a real one if considered aggregational
hence why i mentioned data clipping or power clipping as a way to accomodate for the facility
or the potentiated magi spherical generational gyroscope
which is housed in the s8 folding complex
as a world breaker (or the saliance canvas)
it takes a sequential render of x-plc procs to catalyze real time "portal" instead of tunnels
one simply walks through "canvas" to the other side
or occurs in a tunnel of that motion should there be suspension they are ejected safely

so doing some post research what ive already typed and we can use (the proxy bench)
the proxy bench simply acts as a defusal area (lost and found ai area for profiling gpus)
this is used to advance the registry table with added informations that the bucket missed out
but it doesnt do much it just show sort of the thresholds for the ai bucket and area usage
it would be good to note that some of it counts as lost and found pieces that were misplaced
--
incase of sercing for analysis of fault in the rigging processes it can correct per cycle
it literally doesnt do much and is used with the same time a perimeter is set up (the border)
the border of the inversion decking (which is the most long range bordering perimeter in use)
needs to also be supported if it IS at all used for any reason in acknowledging the program
the program that it is used with is considered a DROPLINE program for that specific allocation
it simply takes the index and rellacoate the lost part as being allocated in a way its replaced
so that when its used again the calculation is not wasted and it refers to the replaced data
the ai of the event sorting and allocating the missing data that it replaces in the ai bucket is
catalgoued for archival in case the data its replaced with it not good enough it will "give up"
the data is referred to as drop-line data that is used in the lattice arrangements to realign
under the necessary weight limits and excess counting signatures of its work order (flush)
once the flush is acceptable with the data contract it is recorrealated into original contract
--
a flush may account for a small level of corruption that is considered over or under rating
so flush levels are monitored
and used in corruption analysis so the overall corruption is tallied with the 'bait flush' count
a reason why this occurs is because bait degrades and is sometimes still surfaceable in use
so during a building we have small occurences of bait flushing so keep the system refreshed
sometime is objectivity in that product needs absolute -zero percent corruption to be applied
corruption matters but due to the quality of the rig corruption is already minimal
deliberate corruptive builds  may be handled in limitation of acceptable ratings (but not alot)
this is to ensure a fast or more prompt delivery however (at a higher cost to power or pay)
the more degradation the longer the repairs take as well as a full system upkeep must remain
just trying to say that the options for "shipping and handling" are and should be cared over
and i dont want to get into that its just part of the economical module settings that account it
--
furthermore the module usage may connect to ampoules or canisters in such a way to exchange
that the modle itself uses a power-relay apart from the entire system this relay is the same
as any other major relay this is an -addon relay or adhoc relay specifcally for calibration
such as a mini or meta iprs (very small module iprs) (forming a micro macro which is for +1s)
made a type calling something so im going to look back (its a long while back when was building)
called a node or a mod a thod or something i dont really know what i was typing but yeah
involved the power nod (or a elemetium quo which i guess i was trying to call something that)
this may involve itself with a high bar power nodes now that i am recanting of this
or a powered (spitflash) or something of a strong pulsuary that forms a hub or something _--we ended up calling something a xpyle too(batter check that for nox-pyles now)
which is going to be helpful with absorbtion takes place during datamining potentiations
because of the gamma or delta func wave i believe there will be issues where this is useful
especially for and dealing particularly for micro-warez waves
this more or likely will take place in vox trafficing over a proxy pad/(ai-basket)
controversely the comptetion is (fucking furious over it if i must say) (effects fortresses)
it simply suggests fortressing use complex ops to handle full complexities in range-parties
--
this was already discernable on its own however im just giving it support to being proven
and may or may not allow for laternating between nitrous nuance and spec-x-ops via gasket
gasket shows itself as being useful in the churn mostly and be now probably apply defusers
defusers will likely rest n the multi-manifold therefore squaring off the quasi-molding of it
and likely allow for an enhanced mammon model that uses modules or has itself as a module
this will allow for mammon based automatons  t3 or (really just t2 with iprs and loics) +xreactor
since we already ahve good automatons we can use the xreactor fortress in a lostrealm esp
this will prevent esp-and-epg destruction (which will automatically occur more than likely in)
makes having an xreactor fortress is necessity for surival in the lostrealm or (x-haven)
--
such that we have an xrender (a launch top/a reactor mid/ and an automaton factory start)
and this is more or less capable of x-render printing, we can go forward with the abs triage
with all abs and platforms and full 'moderation printing-table' (or the xrender server)
we can fortify within an x-relm or also known as go cryptographic
can fortify within an x-relm or also known as a go cryptographic (which we will upgrade later)
also as a premise we can consider the first realm to be x-relm ready, the nether x2, end ,x3
blue haven x4 and xrelm x5 (lostrelm)
in doing so we need the full scale gyroscopic portal bench to apt use roams and extensions
so each relm can be tranverse lineraly
this forms the sequiter portal in which 5 portal states can occur
and this is basically what i have been trying to unify since the first auxilliary in which we use
a methodology of ship systems now and including diamondback and siege scouters as drones
so that we can automate resourcing and outresourcing from our main location in priority use
coutneract for the xrelm resourcing occurs we can perform an xrealm launch and automate
--
this reoccurs on the proxy as the table skate (for which it is bridled or sandle-strapped)
for flash driving bootstrapping of a zipdrive using a "vaporware overlay" in remote access
flash drive for :zscx in remote access idk
this allows cross linking networks to correalate via portal connections
the defusers forms a mini-facuet that connects to the new churn that is abjucated thru vox
i dont want to do it but it would look like the reactor skate with the reactor that is covered
which is later decoded in a magispherical cistern
--
using the bench lotus contiguities as a primer
the occulus connects to the gateway the magisphere connects to the starvault
connections are primed with fob and work beacons
--
im gonna press the buttong because i can and they will maybe stop harassing me
for a floating use of me using it even tho i feel its powerful i dont have to i will press it anyway
this means a fortress in xrelm can situate regardless of environmental conditions of x-prompt
an x-prompt is a predetermiend conditions in which the x-relm has predicated via timeshare of
xrelm and timeshares are datardly, this can effect stratagem if not coordinated
literally the bane of existence for those who situate fortress in xrelm and it not work out
due to elementium incompatibiltiies, this is AVERTED completely if the xcoordination is autoscripted
--
it will also be demonstrated in the x-soldier classes as emmiting an aura (glacial preferred
the case of there being a voidspace the aura may change to an outline or cell shading of self
this is to concrrently project the image of the self in a voidspace (it exists despite voids)

Authors Note 4/16/2024
an attacking feeling, intrusive sadness, becomes to consume. A empty feeling of loss, followd by malice and force.
It opens a portal leading to a determined, persevering gloom, the portal remains, and is empowered, in a breadth of existence, it feels subpar.
forced to inadquency and unfufillment. All consuming and flooding, encompassing and numb, but seemingly tangent and enforced, a policy of slavery.
Perpetual and persistant and emotionally draning, pertitenent and insistent on its reality and atmosphere, by whomsoever has applied this waypath.
It is a work of a depressed, repressed, person, unknowingly of this depth it has created, a working event of golgotha, by my description, all-surrounding.
I look to somehow side-step this, but it cannot be done, only through the mental determination to build my way out, build my way from whatever this is, a flooded feeling of helpless and worthlessness.
I know of things that may assume its quality, but it is not a quality of life in being, it summons from within me memories to provoke regret and mourning. It is the feeling of mourning. Not mine, but one I am to withstand.
I will build my way out of this, I will look beyond its veils and knowing my own outlooks of that will commence to a better quality of life, I have perseverence in this unfortunate feeling that is not mine.
I find it only malleable in the way I will engineer my way from this. It may have overcame to me but I am not overwhelmed by this, knowing, I can change the weights on which this 'golgotha' attempts to ground upon me.
It simply is the soul of the world, or the drastic nature of man, that this feeling is all-sweeping, and all claiming and even to me, all immersive, but while I do not ignore it, or I am forced to live within its mire I will also have my own path in choice.
I simply choose to acknowledge the quality of life that comes from engineering, the building and attempt to surmount this existence from within, not to conquer it but to avert its clutches on yet all it grasps and reaches towards, not to defy it but to make alteration of this fate.
Knowing this serves as a antivenom to whatever has sunk its teeth into my perceptions.
this is not the first time ive written this, maybe just the second time
perhaps inspired from the following invention, i had no written it out becuase i do not have adequate proofing of it, but that is just what it is:
the nox-engine-compound/compression-device (a nox-image processor/projection nox-screen "NOX-vhmimg PROOFER"
i might refer to this from now on i have any lapse of clarity, it is a nox chaos controller--
hopefully now it wont bite literally chunks out of my thinking process

and can personificate itself as the form inended, works well with shadow demon forms ploss
however the form is projected in case of the atual embodiment which is centralized in object
so the residual body takes its shape based on the frequency outline of the aura self-figure
this forms the 2nd state of the phase which is an incarnate status or straform with xrelm
a hybrid esper is possible of this state using prior descripted special arrangements
with the esper reaching a gnell-chimera status of the hybrid
=-
then also works with the legendary sync being usuably in dire-mode or charkra-form (warded)
its very strong and some consider it over powered as tier 4
two top tier3s will make a top tier 4 in this fashion (likely) (or at least at an advanced ability)
the armorment of a tier4 is considered battlecruiser capable and can withstand yamato beam
a top tier4 is rumored to be capable of nova strieks (with extremely powerful overworld use)
is also capable of using any drones of any type therefore it is imperitive to protect in mass
it can still theoretically convert unitsor baselines just so long as they are protected 1by1
conversely having degraded or corruptibility allows the tier4 model to exploit any rate (alot)
such that an empiracle presence or xrelm fortress may be required to withstand exploitations
that is only achieved by being completely free of corruption and in some cases is not enough
the xrelm fortress therefore must have a fully equipped xreactor and compelte chain-rail
the xrelm is immensely control orienteded that grounding will also be useful (siege mitigation)
--
the xrelm will do everything to exploit under the proper conditions with any countermeasure
it does so immensely so an incredible detial and amount of stability to withstand is required
poise of a fortress able to withstand an xrelm assault or crisis is caculatable but uncertain
evacuation orders must likely be taken everytime xrelm decides to cause an outbreak (at this moment due of security inefficiency or inability by imposed nature to provide security)
xrelm is an unpredictable environment in which nothing is garunteed even with measures taken
therefore its only accessed after mass production contracts are fufuilled to the point of use (in theory we have developed this by now---at least by the start of the FIRST REPO-file if not in virtual-providence as well)
a mass production contract for xrelm occupation follows that a 1-8+1 x86 mode is optimum
--
as well as a full starfleet at the ready for disposal which will likely be exhausted afterwards
alongside a full autmaton employ with drones and siege vehicles and all manner of WarFitting (mobilization of units and sentries also require some amount of space)
therefore a double system of 1-10 and another 1-10 for ship including is needed for deploy
no joke that is 20 full rails as described (we have achieved this by the development of the non-extras-files-lists being employed so no worries)
20x more than what i have right now
after two years of fleshing out the workload (give it a fewm more years obviously i will have it in another 2)
it would take me 40 years to preapre each using only one work mech (that is never the case that i only use just one when it comes to building a mass production rail obviously)
that is why i had requested 50 expeditions to make 500 copies or at least 1 each
a totem deployment of that simply is autoscripted such that the yield of the expedition is used
to validate the correct conditions in which the most reclaimability of the resources is planned
this requires No-user other than operatively deploying and retrieving as much as possible
the totem is launched and follows the schedule of its roundabout
and finalizes with its supply
having one work contract expectedly nets 40 years worth of supply that would double over
this rig will grant that contract if allowed to do so can automate that process under deadline
if allowed to automate via its original planning of using robotic employs
it will take a 20 year job of having one rail to make a 5 year job at expectations (i dunno tho)
---
with that also the 5 years of can be used to make a full expedtionary anyway
having a full expeditionary as a backup allows for better use of operative dimensional TOKEN
where each token represents a totem which 2 or more recieved if the rig is at full distrubution
it will double output by having a full rig system ready to massproduce otherwise expect wait-ins
5 years for each attempt or at least 20 for a full slaveship - in which no one is going to do (short of necessity)
and 40 years to take your time  and build yourself which no one is also going to do
=-=
yey having one to think oh i can have in 1 or 2 years a full expeditions isnt so bad when u kno
the stakes are just simply whatever ai already have now being used to make the same thing
would have two mining operation platitudes like the ONE i have now and it would grow into more (or just keep improving like I ACTUALLY DID INSTEAD)
that is simly the work contract that is stupiulated (i would also epect some potentiation of it "improvement as  i said")
so there would be an empowerment for anyone who goes through but also a huge TIMESINK
the timeshink would be 40 years...it would take another 20 years to make up for it in expedition (but what do i know)
so by 60 years its made up for it more or less .. (with 50 it reaching the cap line and a decade)--assuming improvements take that long (i dont think they do)
being any extra profits of now having to really get things in motion
--
afterwards the payout would be basically by every year
while in my system that would just be fine as a massproduced system (i will automate NOW)--(wishful thinking i can get anything to work ever, i cant actually and need real code)
that automation will render the work of what it would take to atually show case what i typed (im typing it but i have nothing to show for it except...drawings and things..even NOW i only have auto-engineered garbage files)--(even tho i technicaly have a whole computer that represents exactly everything im mentioning)
it would take that long + a small time longer for the start up of 2 years per rail
to say i just automate it now would say 60 years can be done in 10 instead of waiting 20-30 (WHY SHOULD IT NOT BE A THING RIGHT NOW!? Even!)
for a total of 80 years of profit that is just to keep up with the original workload contract
having 60-80 years comparitively is not that big of a difference and doesnt really matter (except you know..i dont actually have it right now!)
--
for a century of work it would make anyway that century of the remainder 20 years is simply (a given!)
too much of a lifetime to even spend caring about (except here i am WASTING AWAY)
hence why just let a robot do it (lol)
you will have a timesink full of dishes so to speak either way
--

--
the atronach would likely be purfied and take its form as i would have been describing anyway
lighting basically striking me as im typing this
the atronach is so powerful using the xsoldier (thaeler w/wingset that is gnael) and cyto (coyoto lol bad mispelling)
so that it is fully realizedlegendary crreature and to hybrid that with anything including synx
would make it the most powerful symbiote possible (a nox synx being pretty powerful atm)
as a top t4 symbiote would like be world breaking (a noxsynx might be t5 if not t6, of course there are slivers too, not much difference really)
able to exist in xrelm by itself
using primo version of the blight/nether+/haven meters which would work very well together (or any other under-world i missed)
to reach t5
anyhow that primo is considered mementia
anyways the mentia is an algorithmic substrate used for making a lotus engine based off nodes
that create a power system interfacing virtually with a mentia(even in nitronuance)xtoken

this is basically done by charges on the totem and placing it as a "thermos" into the mammonfort
then basically thats the whole situation we get going that powers the entire "MagicShard"
it turns this ordeal into having a lotus shard basicaly
a scoped engraved auto-turreted ak15 fully equipped motorized mobilized collapsable camogun
with bipedal or quadrpedal and silence long range infiltration and retrieval capability
including thermal and xray vision and drone assisted vision and routing
cryptographic dismantling or circuit miniature engineered and detonationary unit
as well as a cytogenically repairable and reusable auto-scout
this described an armored unit with armored assisted drone to make up for any descripancy
battery cmopartment + ammo compartment + resrouce and drone compartment + collapse
--
using the drone as an assisted flight tool that performs quick and random checks of an area
it can conceal its main body which it can expand to reveal a fully service tacticle rangeweapon
as well as use prehensibility and atv capability including rain and water sealed protections
the size of a minuature totem (housng)
as well as a small unitary carriage system for mountain it can carry evac and rescue 600pounds (or lets ramp it up to 2.4-4.8k)
as well as pilot its own escortable tank system
--
planted into the launch
Concealed Carriage Auto Drone Unit (W/HOUSINGMobile)
Spider Drone (Semi-Large)
w/assists and full carrypak attachable ontank
NVG xray thermal assisted cam sonar radar stealth measures
diamond base model with adjustable expansion (for siege mode turreting)
that is the second time ive built that model the first ones travel is going to be analyzed
using other technology of cistern and trinomial churn motiring it can use drone to charge
and record and analysis its entire nav-path
using dropline tech recieve navpath commands
allows for boosts /drone z-shield generation and powershell
turreted coupling top allows for TOTES also
Drone Equipped sizable jet and propulsion panels
Parking for the X-fae quasar drone/glide spider drone (now with SWARM-orbitals)
Silent-JetGlider
X0fae quadar Spider WarDrone Stealth Glide/Jet Technology
Is remotely automated and piloted viaX-pulsuary Scan
--
base scans area with xpulse then proceeds to issue orders which drone automates and cams
Installed 9/17/21
using xrealm vox-rad circuitry it acts as a t-section notch
allows for module coupling for small camp sets
camping can be sustained by its cargo space and resourcing
Disclaimer This will assess warzone info w/ Auto-prioritize
Able to fully service and secure x-launch with siege modes
--
10 of those unit x-faes are models will complete restore any damage toa ny rig or colatoral (X-FAESER)
--

zone of pilgramage
This is what a tote is (except its been planted) temporary-residency
red means rescue now
green is good
(this chagnes at requests)
Distress results in autopickup
autopickups are secured and quarantined for inspections

as to allow for mammon elementium harnessed from mementia
or chaos elementium
air range operates from lift to lift starting from the first place at sub (max range tower)
this can be used to hold drums for spider hauling of (scp containers too)---we have alot of scp containers--(some are just inmates)
its the culmination of things (i would just finish encosing this thing ti doesnt need to be open)
even tho i would likely build two more buildings over it and two more to probably fit the rest
im just going to say that and those makes this is a 5 count (There is not much more that i care)

9/17/201 4am
im so depressed and everything did not matter in the end i still so empty oh well
fml basically tho
basically a whole building of my isp can be filled with blackmail when they screw over customers
and they are asking for the equivalent of two imo but that aint worth it
0/10 isp service imo (i will complain until its ever fixed and it never gets fixed only damage controlled)

eventually this allows for tulpa regression (or incarnation) where the spirit returns body ---4/16/2021(lol reminds me of a deathcabforcutie song.///kinda cringe)
cistern +churn mammon cauldron speulcher crypt

9/17/2021
4:50am
building the dual-alternating power-converter (pop-reducer)/(xylo enabler)
6:10am finished maybe idk
--
XyloModule uses to i/o ctrl
also fits with quadmeters
XyloModule addon adhoc
allows  for cyto atronach basically
--
10am probably finished idk..nevermind its only a wall
--
going to suggest more psi disruption against hostile-roamers
t1 was scum basically t2 was use minecraft here, stage 3 was starcraftish (came prior to stage 2 tho), and now t4 is upgraded modeling
t4 psi disruption will minimalize xrelm esp and epg (vector activity issues) temporary as its an area of effect)
--
xrealm is like a vortex storm of all bad things so its not gonna work 100% cuz its pure chaos (relatively peaceful ..calm before storm of ultimate chaos in bound it feels like)
that is why this is a most important to enclose this building
--
this will allow jungle templing to be more and more proficient (for our usage)
symbolic of the exntion(extention? extinction?) that wait in xrelm
symbolic of the literally unavoidable extinction---(oh...ya that)
---
in ase you dont understand, xrelm is basically hell insanity mode (it was for me at the time well not really but it could have been)
absorbtion vorporal rifle (basically trades targeted souls for energy and stays charged
--
2ndwall built 11am
--
atma weapon is coming after this
we will have to use the absorbtion canon (shouldnt be saying that but its almost obvious that atma wepaon is coming)
it will be a t5 top raid so i need to complete this building
he will ahve gnaell-cytoforms too
generally a bigger esper than usual
the thing bigger than colloysusus basically (i spell bad sometimes idc)
they are twedging the tournique and it wont work without the microrail trasistor (they are basically drilling into my system with nerve-points...they are vicious and cruel and i must finish this building because they are hacking into my system basically)
it will take xcritical usage (I JUST WANTED TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES)
by converting the micro into a scyto-or tryptocannon (biocannon)---im insane leave me alone lol
the trypto cannon will use the chaos primo (4/16/2024 THIS IS STILL AN OPTION EVEN WITH NOX)
this will work on anythign as a gnaelform (specifically end game)
they are so f-ed if they cross into whati m doing and land on my bad side (they kinda insist on it)
also know as ultra micro
basically shooting steel out of particles to be honesty /and differeintially (4/16/2024 now with quantum functions too)
cancerous differentials particule generation
--
people are screaming over it with their own engines in protest
they dont want me to do this at all (but its like STIRGES over there)
---
because im terragraphing it like a terragraphic steel building of of the terasphere...of existence (so im far away go away)
by using nitro nuance to meltdown metals via differential generation and using a chaos ember
at least now im using chaos ember (before i was only using anything)
--
they are flamingly pissed
--
i could care less because im using it on my own crestal tabernacle covering the stone block
---
they are so mad
baically foaming and threanting to kill over it
been like this all week tho
--
hitting them with the drip (its raining in game so im making that up)
shit is hardcore threatning to kill/shoot people over here cuz im building a tiny fuck-all shelter from them
this shitrain is doing all to stop me
--
literally everything it can do to stop me and it doesnt work (and all my vpn/ip's blaring to get this done)
--
3rd wall up (and im literally hiding between another building and these walls to build this last one
--
full cirtral burst ray system incoming of the micro ultra blast
--
they are so bad for no reason (trying to not let me do it)
--
manifold encrusted prisms
-==-
full weight  hi bar signature diamond manifold prisms
aka rainbow prism
--
druid naked ladies in the woods will be mine
maybe that pisses them off or something
--
4th wall done (3pm)
Phase two with the help of prosper and micro sigma beam time-x
using the shine of the ottemic monument slab to cause occulus
main channel for power source energy (isometric quo)
appears as a strong blue spheroid (memx)
can counterpulse nova and cause psi t5 stasis-lock
also allows for cost free xylo usage
once chaos ember is crreated we fuse it to micro ultura
this forms citral mammon or mammon t3
Operation is also double wide can suit lab/ops and iprs/loic
--
which will allow for the mammon auroc/atronach t5 to fully mobilize as an automaton fortress (the omen)
using hypercase threading of x-rendersthat is limited to only the owner accounts (lol screw them im not letting anyone have it if its that big of a deal they can build their own)
--
zombies and monsters piling up against my building basically
--
with a merkavana (merkaba) tabernacle (nirvana+merkaba)
--
cue maniacle laughter i guess (zombies cant get me)
--
used for differetnial dual sequencing or lotus sequences
the are warded with trinomial class battleships
(triton clas ship modules the rarest sleeper cells availible)
trimegathoeron (the largest xclass utagenic ship of its class)
it would be the size of the entire rig (and capable of using scytech repear x-squad drones)
and can mount scalar ops raids in null space
with zero degrees of ploss if at the advantage of interference wise it would take no risk of
this allow for folding scaffolding rigs of entire hyperspace for full drift and mobial laning
(it can operate as its own stargate (targate) and operate as a traffic controler of hyperspace)--just insane terminology i am bringing up (but is justtypos i think are potentially useful too)
meaning it can direct routes through hyperspace and deny routing of in transit items
making hypertheading a non issue
by performing drip line requestioning of full sytem population
as well as hyperspace tractor system to pull fugituve ships aboard systems
as well as capture glide based sleight system in via quasi spa and faucet gravity wells x-sink
---barely started on right side roof
whil performing an exterminatus as doomsays (TOS denial)
and can preemptive autoscript against barebones breach hacks
because it has region domain control
they can also simulate a starvault (pepperjacking---this is considered extremes and only used even just a few times)
using drum recall to replenish entire atronach energy systems as a full system restore
as replacing drum counts with instant outsourcing of nearby resources through hashsums
as well as using outpout of energy capacities via the t5 mammon (power shielding/shedding)-------4/16/2024 this is so tough (its kind of like grinding my way through hell)
it can create and utilize every aspect for an entire space fleet and force aux system free
it can have 100% shields at any given time in any given space
it can instnatly purge corruption measures and instantly repair and recharge via remote (give it has the charge to do so)
known as the holy grail for x-gating and anamolous returns (it might have a little bit of a cooldown but can do alot)
it can fully maintain tulpetic shielding in zshield space and pwoer shell also with outlined boost
it can full captiual as well as mirror linking reserve
it can afford full totemic occupancy in its own deviced xrelm raid set ups (sweating this out)
it can so as well with a remote xrender without having to integrate in the nominal region spec
it can completely cloak full star systems (idk about that)
it can also devise its own warez which is exactly what it is built to generate in mass clouds of
using dual xkernal system it can perform this all simulatenously (maybe just virtually)
--
as well its collection standard contract rigging and the original rig layouts
as well as shift complete planetary normals down to their molecules (through reprocessing)
it likely can mass convert entirely even despite having protections due to sovereign domain
(it obviously can do whatever it wants to...with plasma nuance and nitro nuance)
as well as fully immunize itself from its own projected temporal rifting while casting targets
hyperbeam (of course hyperbeam is standardized for eery auto turret it has)
it can also fractalize entire self to appear across any connected tangent occupant space (SHELF ADJUSTMENTS)
via quantum teleportation of an active portal to portal intefacing of where it is anchored
and form a warp disruption while avoided said warp disruption or also temporal rift exemption
it looks like a nebachenezzar  battlecruiser titan avi (it looks like...a big mech ship)
with trimegaton gating rails (specific to its x-class model)
its drones are ten engine rail propulsed battlecruisers (such as a xl-maller original model)
original model is slightly more advanced consisting of +4 or 5 engines
as i had projected my own carrier to be assessed as (the drones are basically my tricarrier)
known as the triagedon
is considered a sleeper drone as well capable of full decryptionization of artifacts etc-x
it can also use tangent beam launching for (ricochet of extemrinatus hyper beams its ddayweapon)---major-blocking-charge
as well as homing laser lattice and elliptical targetting (allowed to curve planetary surfaces)
this allows it to strike behind platnerary objects (tracing lasers) or objects outside line of sight in orbit
there is nothing "that anyone can do" it does what it wants
--
can also leech entire squad capacities and energy for its own conversions prior to capture
it can totally screw thigns over basically
it can assimulate full starships into its own plating or powershell absorbing their cargo too
it can also avoid turing termination of a double ring (finality) (it can avoid xrelm esp+epg)---asimnov wepaonization
it can us exciptic translineation to simulate quantum space and perform free travel warping
by ensuing worm hole technology
by using wormhole travle it can build active tunneling and plot/prep a course
should it decide to retoute its coordination between ecxclipse and use hyperspace
it has two types of portals that it can use in multiplicity of themselves
it can simulate its own light speed in stationary anchor (for full quasi exemption) i.e. zerohit
whileing retaining shield status and it can avoid any other strata of temporal shifting
it can basically wage raids while in temporal rift
it can completely over ride and buffering agencyies or broadcasts in its own systems
also cast its own nova under a constant wave while resotirng power and structure to its own
it can also chang quotients mid launch digitally and virtually derender  teleported objects
and can completely disable any competitive force aux or control towers
---
first roof done at 3pm
---
this part here deals with exintction level current events where the bio-0-nullsec becomes viral
this needs to get done and thre are resistances involved (this is largely the compensation rigging)
dont want to do it if my systems arent running and my system decided not to run so i have to
---
they should stop agressing me or i will make them drink die cast molten steel
---
one for nitro nuance one for plasma nuance (all i got atm to justify this massaive effort for such a basic building)
--
they say war is the answer
how about 
unitology versis nicrementalism
---
over a biomassive viral outbreak (oh yeah what morons), and its in NULLSPACE (this only happens on derelicts where you would already have lost!)
i guess they should support me, its a mystery why they wont--i guess sometimes i do get inspired to improve against them though
---
going to have to use manifold troptopping for this one (its a real ropey sort of headboard)--its the cursor adjustment basically, and i didnt institute data-trailing for it..but i can(and also use the rope-in's for it too)--making it quantum-trailed
they pollute so its a crime zone now
this will have to work with synthaesia and prothaesia sccreening for (accessibility)
--
they are basically like putting the sponge on the headpiece to the electric chair in terms of harassment (just over the top level harassment)
--
is literally due to prism reconstruction as an ember prism (and using contouring) hardway)
staples and stitches (its all i have to go on)
--
defcon basically to avoid their shitshoveling
--
defcon works harder with sleeper cells, the outcome is an extinction event
so a global account claim level is likely required to contest it (so they run way cuz globals)
this coinsides with the first phase as well (dumb thing maybe they just are programmed to avoid globals)
like having a soggy rotten scabwound in your BRAIN
--
memewar/crpytographic warzones and encryption/cryptowarfare
--
this scares them (yub yub, yib yib nep nep) --this is their mentality and somewhta their language (they aren't too STUPID, they might be sophisticated in a primal-AI sort of way)
not to mention this module is psy-orientated for interlocking bolstering wave disruptions
bastardizing their langauge: banana my ananayus (hate them so much i hope it infects them)
---
its war and its a blue-goo type of surreal coolgel
blue red yellow green abananadas take a glint hint (trying to infect them with crypto-aids)
---
its beocming alot like the matrix and chaos theory and spirit dissociating in this beeach (they only respond to drastic measures and its proably just only a deterrant)(plus i dont want it to bite me in the ass)
metaphyiscs astral shit soon
atronahc gonna hit the system i guess
lotus kickbacks
--telling them i have defenses since they dont recognize peacemels and diplomatic policies/armistice
red tape situation i guess with color coded ribboning of course
typical and expressionary
they did a big pop at me that i detected
oh well typical corruptable idiots, and their degrading campaigns (they are the infections basically)--viralling out on themselves
--
they probably end up cooking their little triglyceridal meth bombs and dying
--
dar j red etnick red blood red zonered (better than black blood)--(better red than dead) 1 2 3 4 (typical and widow red of course) 5 ----i mightr miss a few complexities but these work good enough
that is a full scale mutagenic
typical of sleeper weaponry (they are trying to sleeper-cast/behemoth song which is ---very bad)--(but they dont get to)
with trop topping and rusteleom (lol paint thinner protector) its pretty much super weaponed
definitely nuclear capable after this i hope
already covered the satchel and peacemel situation
they tried to assault the heroic attempt of their own..failed against my work (they tried an incursion)
it will likely ned up deployed on that
theres not shit they can do except support me
it will likely become a ghpu or setting to finalize
like-x-deocing or something like x-logic
x-rasp most likely
but likely not x-clipping like what is that even
or x-folding lol what the eff do gpus do with that (i know im mentioning stuff but also my explanations are pretty minimal..i would say vulcan but they is not good enough as to how intricate/expansive these methods need to be for  x-folds)
[rpbab;y x-nodes
or x-ploss wow that would be bad to have (we have it)
10 more to go
x-toggling and x-throttle why not
on the xnozzle zozzle
z-pogo x-yolo
split mono stereoscopic semantic y-solo
hope the i/o controllo doesnt get tolledtoll
tolled toooled get it totalted
that probably what will happen is PEAK reaper status alerts
business and workng and having to vsynch both types of throughputs (jeewiz)----I JUST WANT TO BUILD NOT WORDSCRAMBLE
statis and dynamic STEAMING, how in the x-wyrd
autobrakes of course since they wont stop harassing
waiting to happen on me of couse (manifests)
off course correction for the big boomer
Would you like some shoe polish big boomer *aka (no f-off i dont)
all this for the gag reel that will be relayed/rallied of course in transposing synch

it took everything to do and i did it
all that bs in going on

17.6k slides to go

that can inhabit dragon isle
is typically a kobold level deathclaw minuature version (smooth underbelly)
--
a zombie fleet
--
deadbones are the numbeone threat -(gang) death bones their headmasters are 83%risk
the zylo booth is upgraded into being cost free usage but also now a studio booth
for editorial of data or something like a matchlodge
which allows for system lobby (partisan use of a system alongside its processes (gamedevs)
with the match lodge we can "orchestrate" system raid events
there are currently 256 modes of system raids including a lottery system
this allows for homunculus restoration attempts
specialized registrates compete for rewards not limited to carbonpass "allowances"
which can begin at fishing or farming or basic mining stages (where citizens work for pay)
this allows for people who cannot raid to contribute to raids for rewards
everything has a vlaue and even some work contracts can reward payment (such as landfill)
a full system restore of the rig is also rewarded (which ive done)
more or less
argueablyt for homunculus restorations
which arbitrary it just should mean im allowed granted ownership or arbitrary region detail
--
meaning i decide whats what in terms of what rewards or what jobs are done/given
obviously that is going to follow protoocl but helps to once again make partisan esp+epg rite
threfore if someone does something against the epg+esp regulations they are criminals ...plus there is an epg+esp mac which involves meta-data/meta-rigging handle of meta-systems and metasploting/nmaps of meta-contiguity
and u dont need me to say it but i would take it persoal on my region and respond in a way
--
the reaction is terminable
and therefore compensation is awarded to the offended party and insurances are made
3495 current complaints are filed and are now in my actuary (or my providence of income)
this includes other land rihts and negotiated settlements of which i do not compromise much
and if a sacred infliction then i wont compromise and demnad immediate and full indulgence of
or we will initialize a new almsden approach (almsden is a codeword for a plague-apocalypse) (which is exile for most of the remiander alive)

--(this already happened and technically in my lore..there are survivors of the almsden apocalypse) for me almsden was 2008-2012-2018 just the beginning of a few years of plaguewalking zombies (or terms or a decade dpeending on how you percieve it starting up)--it started with swineflu and exagerrated from there.
Sars/SwineFlu and everything set the course for almost a real life almsden too but thats just a conspiracy theory, i just recognize that it was more of a trend/craze during those years of "zombie survivalists"/ and walking dead was big on it too (it was something that effected us and was very prevalent day to day)
--i never asked for an almsden scenario but it seems someone got their wish, it seemed like it was just what the world became, so i coined it that and now its more or less "over". then corona happened...so maybe, its still going on somewhat. alot of shit happened because of almsden reaching a climax of something.
thats just my understanding i was always world building and before then even making nosleeps...but almsden was more like ---nuclear training if anything, except it happened to also occur during a massive epidemic. its alot like the game h1z1 actually if h1z1 had any storyline. dont get me started on the nightmares.
--there are some almsden monsters...some that even are very darksouls-esque...some i just know...might end up as darksouls material (worm face was one of them)..(they dont have all of the ideas...though)..i really just dont think they even know what they are messing with...one day will just happen to remake some.
---then its over, i guess, we will just have to accept the monsters are somewhat..."popular again"--one of them happens to be wyrmbeak (which is not fun to deal with)--anothers are the hounds of adramalech but i dont think they know it like i do.

so its not really a game and therefore the matchbox is very important
fabled use of the exile longsword is the free reigning of that vocation (admin vocation)
that was after 15 minutes of grinding
MonsterHole LOL
easy place to lava burn the drowned
Aka the searing station (only one i have cuz i never would)-wuld
oneof a kind idea inspiring for sear-plate from a terrain
the sear plate might be just what i need in place of the skiller for the printing table to xproc ---(this is an early stage arc weld back when i didnt know what they were)
with the cistern having a seal plate makes sense sort of but more of thermal reactors
at high bar usage it would be very useful (if not the exact thing i was looking for)
for the business usage of xtoggling states
will be great to have a skiler tray and a complimentary tray with it (cuz i needed one)
wasnt sure what to call it too knowing it was aggregate skillet tray to the other partisan
incredibly glad i went and did this situation
--
because i dont have to concentrate of missing components hardly at all now
--
that was the only missing component i was aware of too and it irked me but im cool with it now


*****off note
the feeling to design a game is washing over me
infact its getting bad
its overwhelming
so i am going to establish a simple game

character on a platform
the platform submerges into an elevator
1st floor entry level complex
locked room and decontainmination and entry registration
entered of the lobby and identification charting
character is granted a simple residency
door opens up and allows character to occupy his chamber

the chamber is transported to an allocated spacing
the character can now securely establish a daily routine
a sample routine is given
the chamber is opened after the player has finished customizations

the chamber opens to a courtyard
a vocational capable task is assigned
the character establish tutorial expertise and invited to a conference meeting platform
the platform virtualizes a task management team and the character is given their first assignment having passed evaluations
the character must perform the assignment under task monitoring

the character completes the assign and is graded, and is allowed release to be returned to their chamber
the routine of the chamber follows forward that the character has made an achieved measure of progress

the chamber is released to an upgraded residency, but goes haywire, forcing the character to employ their vocational skills and restore their secured living quarters
the facility is raided and power is diminished only to important places
the platforms are blocked with natural obstacles and monster types indicative to the players ability to fend off
the complex is further sent to hazard and the player must rescue/defend/repower certain platforms in order to make their way out of the "vault" back to surface
surface there is a raiding/rescue party with the motif to capture and transport any survivors to a functioning facility
--
player is tasked to a new security complex with living quarters
player is sent on expeditionary work and supplied the means of their vocational choices
player is eventually granted a vehicular expedtionary team in which to set up security stations and node-works
there are many outside hazard including duststorms/weather-flood etc including mudslides and boulder-zones
--
player continues to set up a main working branch for their own expeditionary task force, with rescue/raiding capability
player dispatches their team and sets up further node-work upkeeps by technological upgrades and commission of rescue/services including mercenary recruitment
player employs security dispatches and containment procedures or uncontained/outbreak ordinances
player begins to weaponize their facility for longe range operations involving dispatch/ordiance on call and can provide air strikes/shelling and reinforced backup vehicles and squad parties
including routing/logistics and trap/fencing (droneworks)
***
trying to get back on track now

because it wasnt complimentary and using dual skillets did not make much sense
it made sense but i knew it was sort of a drawback
because i wanted full unique differentialism
so i can practically "go without saying" the underlying tray issues
this allows for better salvage through disenchanting material (better materials of salvage"
and saves me alot of work from de-contaminating over-radiated parts
it synergizes with the decontamination process alleviating some of the demand (still happens)
and is really the first real case of synergy ive had in a long while the first being meta serve
will allow for basic auto finalization of standard salvages
which is like an end tier perk
in sc2 it would be like having a better output of svc usage
made possible by resreach of course (also with enhanced resourcing comes enhanced combat)
ive been playing it a little but whatever
--
hype rant (even tho its been 8 years since it was released)
i never got to really enjoy it
and i d beat the cmapaign mostly but it was nerve racking and i didnt agree with alot of mechanics
it took everybit of my experiences to even begin to want to reference it
lets just say while it meshed up somewhat it was not exactly a smooth scenario
also their gameplays are just really bland and full of conflict
--
(blame a person) i dont like maybe that will fix it
--
needs of to manufacture an antigreeze component (not necessary anymore)
the domo dom (blade dom altar) can be now broken down) into salvage parts using last build
(this is basically the skirt reciprocal heavy weight nuclear war eahd that we disassemble)
therefore compelting the disarmment challenge
and saving our lands with this very rig this magnifient rig that saved us from nukes
--
automatic disassembly of nuclear warheads and tactile protection measures of networked bases
so long as it remains maintained
x10 rigs in a row of each other would be logisticslly the best system availible to use
known as the scytheaxe railing (thats what it resembles)
our behemoth koleperas (kobolfclaws) will protect us
alongside the extra mac we emplaced after the xrender processes
this is to prevent systemic leeching frmo other accounts or enchroaching parties
we eventually use the system to rid ourselvesof unwanted bogleech infestations (untested)
bog leeches are the worst pest/plight much of the medieval/adventure world (they are big)
and ugly and just all around voracious and menacningly apex
i didnt want to bring them up becuase they are overwpowered
domodon is the biggest bog leech is also known as angular bogleech (uses bait like a mofo)
it is considered a nuclear level bogleech and even peracons (our taurguards) have trouble
in a crisis outbreak or apocalypse event domodons are incredibly agitated and enraged
that bring about zoning destructions and they thrash around until the event is settled
they are also nautrally maruading around swamps
if the swamp is a ruins swmap is a domodon will definitely be lying in its depth theres avoid (the drift rail technically crosses a swamp terrotiry and is natural to its affininty and xtype anyway being the subconscious natural rem state (or commonly anyway)
regular leech swams are a problem bogleech swarms are somewhat of a pandemonium
they rival the synx in voracity
least the synx is somewhat managable in all its "depravity" its madness can be supressable
the bog leech is in that regard undeterred and cannot be corraled as its compeltely savage
and it cannot be satiated and will continue to engorge itself until itsoverwhelmed by weight
the sync on the other hand is mostly driven by lunar dispotions and can be made "docile"
still should be handled under extreme caution and generally maximum distancing of container
a bog leech container can be relatively smal before it is phenonmelly enlarged
the second a bogleech begins to debour it grows in size exponteially and rial autotamons

doing a skyline screenshot of the rails entirity at this point in 9/18/2021

the totem is an impurity that can be cleansed with measures taken for its removal
the removal being that it is pruged as an impurity or treated as an scp container

Lift rail start of reactors
Halfway through reactor check

auxilliary/boost side
*(totem)
checkpoint 4
that reactor bonus allow for quad sections (t-notch are quad-notchable)
this conflicts with incremental stirping and (sheet sleeving) (see unitarium and pin linking)
conflicts with guildgrafting basically it conflicts with interweaving bandwidths (which are bad)
thats what i mean by it is like tearting at violin strings with a crossbow
like when you are using adancing milling and tear up the hemp  in a way it can be rethreaded
it will then generate friciton or coal residue and burn to the gorund if not repaired quickly
therefore it runs with greasebits
or some other lubrication digital (downsphere lubing)
which cycle back to it being quadsectionable (questionable) that is allowed for the pizza(quo) as mentioned
for a fully expresed virtual engine feedback
this shows through lotus kickback seuqencing
and makes a better computer than a x86 lotus shard server
this alloows for full cryptographic takedowns so dont mess with em
which can run on thing filamen i.e. basically heat death by its own empowered ploss rates
as long as abosroption modes are sustained (and digital vamping targets are avialible)
much of the time the mode is uniinitiated but will intiate if the cris deems necessary responsibly
this will debase an economical system even for others in cross-networking (so its isolated)
--
can essentially force a nether mode and allow for remote/withewstompiong (fortress Dotting)
it gets worse the more empowered it is and it couples with any other aoe or dot effect active
which can also debuffer secure systems and instantly corrde other building (silent effect)
Checkpoint 5 Vocational TurnoutPoint
byy the way they tried to us chemtrails to flush it out of my busineses and failt
--harasment as well was happening
Wanting a hamburger at this second (save it 4 later)
barometric totems probably
up to town
any purging that needs to be done wasnt reference is done thru blue-ball  pepper jacking 
for those who dont do this properly there is always pepperspray the poormans spray
we typically peppermace the black ustang whgich can be depicted as landform such ahead the left river
blue paper milling (known as in the shard reprocessing using nuances of raw+nitro/plasma)
and generates chaos nuance which is t4 raw=chaos
raw--> chaos nuance is used all to form dark plasma nuance
this allows to open the memx-occulus or also contain it and control it (due to dark plasma)
prior it would simpy be uncontrollable through variable in its favoring
it would pter out in a dropline yet be immensely powerful now we can use dark plasma for it
