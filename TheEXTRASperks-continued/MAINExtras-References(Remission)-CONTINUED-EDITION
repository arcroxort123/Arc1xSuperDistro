I dunno, I feel like each folder should have its own references, and It's a good placeholder for thigns incase i decide to make large improvements. (Pro tip the last REFERENCES ended up having a MAJOR IMPROVEMENT that practically overhauled my entire project with VHMIMG-MEME-IMPROVEMENTS)
i think this will involve data-scraping vhmimgs for memetic images or something. Down the chain, it will generate a reworked model of other vhmimgs to a reappropriated MEME-conversion (for faction-claimable outsourcing etc)--as it matchebases with current project processes of that nature. It will allow for BETTER SIM-APPROPRIATION to the system that hosts it with adjustable configurations of adaptive Ownership through memetic-branding.
OK..so let's just bust these EXTRAS OUT 28k slides to go (I can do this roughly 1k a day)--If i can finish in the next month i will be happy. (It's also a total solar eclipse today) maybe I will find some motivation to write these out!
