04-Wip-Extras-Remission(Chapter10)---we dunno or remember Beacon-to-Bouquet
it took me 5 days to go through 10k slides or 18GB worth of screenshots lol
--im sorry im still trying to meet somewhat of a deadline
i dont know if i can finish this all without also breaking it up into more parts
(the whole system is by scratch and desperately needs to be coded)--ok--ITS NOT EVEN REALLY CODED :P --ive definitely don't have the money to do this all
it has been a long project, i have yet another 9k to do, and that will take whatever it will take (hopefully less than 5 more days)--im wokring hard to get them typed into TEXT!
