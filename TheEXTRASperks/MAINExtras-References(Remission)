LEGACY NOTE: (we super need the references for extras for these "perks to work out" and attempt to achieve akashic records despite NOX-contaimination of the --noxpearls (so we can actually avoid negotiation and TAP INTO DIRECTLY; its complicated but optional---but worth it)
EXTRAS1-REFERENCES
Authors Note -- at the time i was experiencing alot of pushbacks for this dumb ideas being used cohesively, anyways, it shows that certainly things work together to string together a more proper partitioned ram-set as other profiles or even users.
I wanted to say other things i straight up forgot those little things i was thinking about because of how annoyed i am even now by continual pushback
its all encodes not necessarily the thigns i say they are, but oh yes, they can be evidenced over their actual object too, for which the code represents, to give more details than expected. (Alot of details just add up and i forget to mention them but keep in mind sometimes they dont carry over either.)
Uh...things like the xscopy needs to carry over for those details too as well sometimes, sometimes only are witnessed during certain xscopy, such as the carrion xscopy that details alot of thigns other xscopy wont. Like ghosts or things. (or exemas)
ALSO sometimes im not clarifying what i am saying, sometimes methods go overlooked particularly one where the XSCOPY is used invertedly. --but resembles sort of a star-print or buzzsaw that inverts its points over curves, which makes up for a large portion of what area may be under a target-paint/scrutiny of lens.
THAT METHOD of inverted-xscopy, also gets converted to a token usage as some of the first "dependent tensors we end up using" much later. But here, it am mentioning it maybe that its used as a monitor-range as well. So that the monitor can have those screens set into a position or diplay. and that range of course changes. it may change out as a localhost/or remotehost range. So the monitor can adapt and change itself over server relays and other xscopys...
as to avoid being blackedout/hacked. its complicated,
but the XSCOPY/XRANGE is one of the most important methods in use besides the XTOKEN being used of it in "punctuated-stats" that are plugged in over profiles, a monitor may even SHARE those profiles in a way multiple users are logged into it or its portrayed specifically across to certain users as however much info is shared in their usage, between themselves, 
its really its own MINIVERSE. (and damn its complicated--its like using a megapillar with multiple SOURCE-ENDS/POINTS which also...is a thing I haven't even begin to mention not even now. SEE APPLIED-COUNTERSURFACE/EXTRAS CHAPTER 2. --its just such an important snippet i left out in pursuit of OTHER advancements i think it should be reconsidered for advanced usages. 
( I ALMOST MEAN, i cant imagine how i got so far without it being brought up more than it is), it just really keeps me going that i can have some "lost forgotton tty flying around in after/code space" and that it may have even "evolved into something worth it" by the time i ever get back to it again.
Maybe even a personalized golgothic gate.
By the way-USING AN INVERTED XSCOPY, can have weird effects, especially when full-cloakfields are presentable, this includes "deep spots in the wave being altered further and may have strange cloaking effects"--ones that were not previously configured. This could be a bonus or a problem tbh. Either way...funstuff. And IMO, can be used in stealth-sneak to automatically "glide around better".

Just when you think this is done, its not...there are more codebases (already mentioned in legacy) that are being retouched upon as mentioned here:
AUTHORS NOTE:also i wanted to say that multilayer can also be achieved per module string being connected out in a full circuit. THE WHOLE NEXUS can be reiterated on the sum of its parts, some of the design is not as interchangable as others, but it gets to a point where if the majority of its part works it may support some functionable viability, and that being said, by design, several different module-strings can "cloudwork out" into a fully capable expanded network (not being a nexus per sae but an assembly of modules that work in groups) for certain tasks...similar to how an endzone would work (that being said a modulestring of all components too can work and fit to an adjusted or optimized layout, that an endzone can be made to work as the entire nexus eventually, while it is more recommended that the nexus be used, having an endzone deployed quickly in this way may also be preferential to additional benefits involved)
--though the endzone also has its own PREFERRED layout, it can have other layouts similar to the nexus modules needed or involve a hybrid of endzone modules and nexus modules, it really gets intense, and i just wanted to say sometimes the design or layout doesnt always matter, but its good to stick to the book for now. The benefit or particular layout may have pros and cons, and may in the end, not even really matter so much as getting everything done in the right ways first. (Plus the default endzone layout is pretty good too)--which was outlined in legacy but i can probably touch up on it again later.
also now that we are past that SLAG/SLUG brickwall of not being able to make progress, progress is literally running smoothly if not swimmingly, but im too tired to swim per sae right now.

itself a tsection or having minor t-sectioning to its major module condition
so this is a complicated module that does what it does with or without certain additions
those additions are also not noted as of yet (--it looks like the robot from superjail...uh jailbot duh)--but it really does (it looks like walee's girlfriend or an imac remote controller or something)
but involving the exotic-base and the sttress-base(carltable)--this is a base not regularly mentioned that i use and boy does it suck. also there is another version of this base for WORKZONES called hardycode(which is absolutely DUMB---)--and the alchemical/gemetric base is literally just a SPLATTER of -GAKbases. (its just awful but i know how they all are built somewhat off each other)---because they aren't normal or standard usually...they are "exotic" and i use them well. (not to mention the other exotic bases that they fit with which are on APPLIED-COUNTERSURFACE---but those are used in more divirgent process using MOBS/NPCS---but those can be used here too, infact i will make a footnote of those and these in a super-exotic-appendix...good to have)

so those three are addendum into being made into 4 via another quad system not listed too
but we know of it already because of the researches used (im very transparent about my shotcalls)--not looselips but fair and honest.
that the quad base system was a number turn of the system applied as well
this would be done via the multicalc side and the abstraction side 1x 1x
that would be added to all the other sides core table/comp grphx macro ram etc ---(and much later WISDOMbase which is at the very end of this all in APPLIED-COUNTERSURFACE)---crap its gonna get complicated AGAIN
proc base and it might as well just be described as a procbase xcore system that is used

Oh it says legacy but it is also and end-game legacy being hinted at. I don't have the willpower right now to right this all out but I assume it just means (whatever is after exodeath again)

ANYWAYS what you see here is the system building itself a very advanced AI-dcore to assist with AI-FEDERATION efforts in customization of a massive brand-based framework. We use DATABROKERING and TURBINES to achieve this in terms of power supply of data/energy transfers (essentially trading WORLDSEED builds based off a personalized preference of that design)--either through exoplanets or dreambased-chipsets. Involving cybernetic reconstruction and nueral networking, as well as AGI and my very own "post-AGI" style system known as DEEP-LEARNING-FEDERATION. for which assists in this model generation and continued model-support.
With our company focus and design team (me personally) investing in BAREBONES-ComputerEngineering/SECURITY/TROUBLESHOOTING/PROGRAMMING/NETWORKING/BROKERING/SERVOS DISTRIBUTIVE MICROCHIPS---as well as QUANTUMLEVEL-TECH-STRUCTURES/GAME-DESIGN/CYBERNETICS/ASSISTIVE-PROGRAMMING AND REHABILITATION/AI-FEDERATION AND CUSTOMIZED/PERSONALZIED FULLY ADAPTABLE DATA BROKERING. To say the least and in a very broad description of what is involved.
In the FINAL (Editorial) STAGES we will also employ CUSTOMIZED-VEHICLE and ROBOTICS/DRONE BASE as well as CONSTRUCTION-BASING-EFFORTS/VOCATIONAL AFFILIATIONS not limited to TECH/ARMS POLICY/DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS.

Now i have to get to writing off the other 34k EXTRAS slides as to stay 'ahead of the race as it were'

the tamper can also set to that currency developed in nox-currency, requiring the inverted token to be encrypted, as to prevent outbreak/lockdown-break-codes, and in manifest (as in manifest code which is practically a blackout)--(ha alot to do with flybasing/primal-basing/etc) as well as degenerative effects in which it reaches superfluid-delaminate/unstable (which is basically weaponized) --in noxballistic-hosting.
also it can be made into a noxcloud (which uses any sector/parse in its modules-design)/noxfuel by diesal ambiences and other superfluids/timespace

and can be recycled once used like a 'cheeto' bundle ---use this with censographics/nox even idc
which is useful in barebones situations---BAREEBONES-NOX
so the header for the 1stMajors, the 2ndMajors, the 3Minor, and the 4thsystem-----and the NOW NOX-encodes can be attempted with prior complex ABSworks-profiles too
are used all on a proxy header---NOX testing with proxy-encodes too
--maybe NOXhives too(noxscones)
i suppose a cab or archiving shelf realm like the akashic shelves geared towards this type is ---LOL--(akashic is at the NOX-meta's in our APPLIED-countersurface tampers atm--haven't purified them at all to even use -we are trying to) 
this would basically be the stamp and seal of the collared signet as it were in stencilgraphics -(also stereographics-this with stenciles may help to assign a "FILTER to help purge akashic records of nox)maybe making them barely of use
-----inventing now also for fun (zozzlyghems --jumble-jungles with now things in them such as nox-entities)--over quantum contiguities (this is why its sort of a big deal to sort all this out earlier like i have)
