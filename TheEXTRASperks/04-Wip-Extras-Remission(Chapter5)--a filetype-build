netmesh that:
using a microwave based protection system
it creates a stealth shield
from proper use of the psy operation

unfinished helix halfstep goosestepped torque elevator
Weight limit 700
no entry don't use
another useless game system falling to pieces in front of me cuz of bad "R-n-G"/rng
fruit helly sweetbread carrot spice(spirche)(spirneche? granolo(granola) mix beetsoda 7 and pumpkin cake /cactus powder
potatoe stew with same spices makes 9 or 10 items
so a mixture of that ai can make about 20 items
and snack gumie cancdies with flavorful berry stuff
then with livestock of course food from that and cheeses and a full menu of gourmet topping
and fish sea foods and oriental sweetfoods (cherry sakura) or subsidized dimsum
also a toothpaste and soap line
so thats like 20+10+10 or so +2 (42 foods)
so a full deck of foodstuffs and paste(pasta)
so i can make chip dip too and mexicanmix foods and culture food
and pasta sauce and pasta
most food i can almost make
for corn i have to rely on starch mix (alchemy)
and other byproduct meals (cornmash)
and can make english style braekfastes


i can make almost all of it except for authetntic corn stuff so i guess glucose free stuff
the logic gate as a cape print (idea)--for wings

*harassment

4/14/2021 (took a break i guess)
deciding to built a giant wall (i built a wall)
did this before but forgot its been like a month
takes like an hour to lay out half the wall as fast as i can at like 10k blocks

--they basically toured my tiny state to harass me

i guess a toll lane for the last one and the other for shade lane
then plasta in what i need to
using a rss pane to simulate a locking screen
the plaste is incognito basically ...so many other things across all of this is just...incognito unnoticeable stuff (its noticeable but not really pronounced)
im not catching no biggie's-fade sorry (and that i mean im not getting knocked out over some dumb hole in security)
im not getting noccked the fuck out aight (and yet here i am handling the nox 3 years from now...or so its basically powerful stuff)
one line basically represents 42 slave hours (if it were rl and was using slaves i guess)
that can replicate all the entirty of this platitude (the nexus is not the platitude, the region is, but its advanced enough of its own to be its own region so i call it that)--anyways tongue in cheek stuff
it takes me 3 hours to build the wall to myself building it alone (3 others or so for the other half its bigger tho so its lke 8 hours)
this can fit about 8 horizons with spacing 
---(alot of the rig is just day by day projects each totally a day in themselves) with sporadic upgrading
to a bump it can fit 16 with layers inside
and compact to more to 20 (im marginalizing constantly what it can be made efficient to do so i can optimize everything, sometimes just enough  to justify even talking about it at all, sometimes i will appraise it as some great effort just to put a single tiny patch into place, and call it such an ordeal)--cuz it is
which is the number im using for this i guess more or less
everything fits in
so the trail can go through all horizons --i will do a tiny look worth like one second of my time and equate that to 4 hours of work cuz im so exhausted anyway---i will build a tiny module and call it like a 2 day project even tho its an hour, because the WEIGHT of the task is actually...too daunting to fathom)
i really think it can fit 50 some off worth of hoirzones in it if side by side (trying to act like my nexus will network stack from the bedrock to the sky as 50 layers)---they later increased the range at how high buildings can be built too for me so i ended up taking advantage of this and going for it with all)
10 a level i guess (that would make the nexus like 3xtimes as big with the increase in size, it can have as many as 150x layers or more depending on how compact it is)

i contingue to build the rest of the wall now that i caught my breath, its like....building thru all the disrespect and heat of sitting there in a chair, just sloughing out mouse clicks.
..and at the time i had bad airconditioning and everything was just a subpar experience---i use it as a massive excuse that my time was spent not being completely shit..even tho i can tell the text at times just looks like absolutely trash---(what cna i say my life was shit lol)
5 of there monitor boxes side by side makes 10 fitting for the walls
plus two or so for the front and back space
makes 12 and then the floors can of course be covered by the walls instead
i would value this thing as a massive monumental building at 352 million (if it were made of basically trash)
teleporting is it possible i think so the photon interacts with a simulatedphoton (asking the imporatnt questions of possibility)
wall is 90% finished cuz i ask dumb things in between--not only is it made out of trash its made out of THOTS
This wall is BEEN built in a day
really just 6 hours or 8 hours or so with breaks
--Now my nexus is a GIANT box that rains down codes in a (faction rain of code) and NOT deathrain for me plus i have some nice shade to enjoy LIFE

Describing submodules of the ABS-loops/dataprocessing
LogiBracket
corners can be socketed too or can be used to condense cent
centerpiece is mixed with othes based on freq and use/can be hybrid
Creating a hybricent core (based off a datalocked raw filetype)--similar to what i described as the nox-teraflopy but for RAW data (this is just me doing my thing at this point)--i didnt know i would revisist the thing as being a nox thing (but it takes some work explaining why i didnt remember these things)
----
because they are subprocesses to submodules is why i dont remember them much (i know that the details hold together like in this case for file-type making) --on the abs line
outer corners of the field might be flanged
---hence its a toaster artifice
or varying size this one is 8bits
this creates a virtualized circuit (as in the file type that is passed through and formated to the ram storages --its fast, and the data-cent is image snapped---this would be the first case of the datalock in actual use

these arent compatible but become comatible with the reactor fitting and being virtualized (their bases can then easily be adjusted as complexities are needed
this reactor fits two differerent types of brackets
need to install text forwarding as well for the text coordinating on calc

*******************THE FIRST POWER/FILE TYPE INDUCTION
--im just gonna explain all the signs i can see of the abs department now cuz i need to straighten it out here and now

MicroChip Drive/Microdiskette /implant monitor / or product tester
tier 2 pink purple green (just example colors) 
it just corner stones the fields with pink purple green
too lazy not even gonna draw the example (a cornered patch)
--pass to logicbracket
--pass to viral chamber
micro chip diskette integrity check and dapater case (or multi-shelf)

---dropdown--filetransfer
file build: sediment/left side/quotient/right side/toaster field
3 steps have sediment 1--2--3 Tier 1
this potentiates the file compression for transfer/ to a full write circuitfile (like a diskette)/the circuit diskette is read later on a drive or ssd/it can be mounted or allocated in hardprint

SIDE NOTES HERE: HERE IS A CANE MACRO TO HELP THINGS RUN SMOOTHLY
Simple coriolis formula here gets turns into a ballistic-mpacket
mixes with raspdropping (reuport datadrop)
this is also like a flex or focal
helpful to make distinction by types 1 23 4 
where 1basic 2 flex 3 focal 4mpckt
--
this can also be used with doxtrays or port-trays (experiemental)--this is specifclaly for LABWORKS
for a streamed base data analsysiss
(it uses a gap tecnique in a refined hellset)
or work of interferences
such as a GENBASE Nuke using exotic measures (exnuke)--for data
this will analyse displaced fields or particles/partices
i.e. by also using addon calc system etc
(this system is known as CANE2)


---dropdown--filetable/thatcher/swatcher
this will potentially a peak performance as its a fulldraft safety rack
and allows it to massproduce at  higher efficiency safely
basically this is an overdrive that keeps it from burning out
it is insulated at 100 pieces to 144 spacing or 288 duplex/interwoven/alternative
GREEN GLASS FILTER
---dropdown
DBRIDGE-fluxtable MSET
interlink bridge table
this is the gestation output of the incubator filetable basically
GLASSFILTER YELLOW
Static DOORWAY (electrolyte dump)---THIS MAY END UP BEING PORTABLE AS QUOS but for now they are UNREFINED (they are soon refined either way--so they are dumped)
either by ABS or thatching (it dont matter unless the process is to UNREFINE THEM)--it kinda matters tho (to say that From AUX TO RAM it matters, if you go in reverse it matters the other way being it DESTORYS/UNREFINES THINGS ANYWAY)

--dropdown (file aggregation and "crane selection and emplacement" for file-organization and prep for threading
this will also multilevel or train the progset, but all it does is form a nitroblossom (reticale base)
that reads out as useful or not later they are worth it
i guess if u want content or mass product in a image docking
(we already produce our own textures and 3dprocs)
its useful for item hasing so i guess meta-casting
with solid state filetypes so it can read shells different
then u can compare the worldloads and maximum later
also it can use finalized product to create bacup diskettes i guess
--
this is for rocket or banana or capilliary emulcificate idc catalyst x4 (mixing)
this is basic mode but can advanced to mini mod and combiquads
so it can be basic +small set 
+dual core/mini+-
and quad corner
4 sets ((4_4)x4)  or 32x4  128 ez
options are rockets/bananas (as to how to swap piece to other piece)
or an or an / plasma/OPTIS (this takes away shape discrimination)
this is what i would call the grassCoder it takes hashups ----(MonkeyGRASS-hypernets..only my version before i even knew what they were or existed)
it gets filtered through and assembled really fast
then comes out like a ballistix code with very optimized inputs
--
can also use optiscans to write fox sets
and can hash dox for fast read or error or items of itnerest
including focal points or hackatattacks
turns grass into partices for parsing basically (native/local code into sampled quo-based)--by transcoding
they interwork with hypertrhead for fast alternating packt
this gets inverted later with censorygraphing (encryptions)
centerpiece:this is interlinekd onto the bana conjoiner so can passthru
--
the connection armatures go thru the receptacle idk
the BananEncode
a tri symbol next to split lumbar or double sparks
creates a vortexial nexus or a standing reasengan basically
cliche dowsing (dowsing shields)
tpermutable viragraphic
--
endpoint of fileaggregator-
able to hijack with use of warez and full warez materials
conveys a raw attempt (which is amzing)
use of warez in case did (break a server)
fractalis was not used

This is a UPDATED THROWSWITCH
DEGAUSER STITCHBAR
this single bar handles static build up it was updated 9.8.2022
after three year i decided to put it in to allow exfoliated/compile
it serves as a tap filter when the system mac goes into accel modes
because it handle shockerpowers it can reorder the xturbines
and switch out hypercritical states which would corrupt
it is only good for this spot between TAPzone and DataBanker
it can be used other places between refactor but is not 'great'
it has 11 parts:
1
Example of Large tapping station with cargo hold (it resembles a person with switches on their joints and they are in sports gear like roller blades--believe it just works somehow)
facility templates using core tools can also be designed with tap (it looks like a GOALIE lol)
2
a taplocker pane basically inset for tapping pane
there may be beter modules in use for VIP or speicalized sets
this is a standard tsector pane for economy usage
3
This is known as tapping pane it is made of 4 tsections (they look like a noisemaker clippy
provide details and informations and chart maps and carry order
this can help with alarms and alert and MOTD and objective
basically the bulletin system that can be adjusted if need
POWER Type CARTRIDGE
powerswitches seperated by buttons and a passure pad between those, and hidden signs in pockets for its fuses
a1:securit settings admin settings optional licenses schedules ETC
a2:manual settings / fulcrum usage / data levers ETC
b1:Program Chamber
b2:lock settings /access levels/ stocking LINE UP/ timers etc
--so that is the TAPPING PANE WITH DATA INSIDE IT PROGRAMMED
4
Like having a build in smoker that has program to work cmds
exmaple of minimal TEMPLATE TAP PANE with some cornerFUNC
these can complund to other tools or coresets too
--
many of these require fuse packs, which are housed inside, this helps to route power relays to capacitors, so charges can be redirected accordingly, for manual and analog electrical breakers of crcuits
its basically a control sensor/tensor with widgets on its sides including lights and switches etc to show what setting it is
5
HOUSING EXAMPLE can also be wired to work with attachingments
Tapping Panes can be rigged to work with other panes too
-there is also  agital version that is overlayed in a powershell
these are used as header or module placements
or for easy diagnostic and readouts for arching
they are made as adapters and require them to--but they can connect and help secure QUADBAY access
QUADBAY access is a hardline access to other quadsectors
In a virtual setting many quadbays may be in use
each will help navigate a virtual board and qualize pwr
(ITS A FUSE HOLDER FOR THE TEMPLATE CONTROL PANE) and acts as a better than average comparator with multiouts
6
A full system can be designed to light up when in use for example
or create a functioning sound balance (imo great project)
Quadbays can lockdown quads as well as lock themslves
they are effective for reserving capacity power
as an indepdent support system that sustains variant-Sections
A quadbay can also be programming to a schedule
for stocking and regiment and security etc for management.
Many stations can be set up to work as Fullbars (for custom prefs)--and be lit up in use
7
--next to an adhoc module for remote use within system (permission may be required and may house some onboard encryptions or waps)
8
This is for standard active use
POWER RAIL DETOUR WITH SPLASH GUARD (item selcection)
this is the transfer gate (for pickup)
such with an active/virtual render system 
this is also useful for coordinate power-relays
if managed correctly can be used with an aux manifold system
this can be automated with tapping grids
this will handle miscellaneous transfers using also pack-routing
requires a routing office of course, which , other pane can
this can sustain a mid level rack refresh rate
P1:entry platform and coordinator
P2:exitplatform with rail directory (gatepass direction)
This helps transfer raw material for prep work or refining
TRACK AREA 2 LANE ASSIGNMENT
TRAC AREA 1 COLLECTIONS
9
The freakin electrodal readouts
this uses polar combustion with debris and pol-delfections (non interpol-interfences / anti-cahffe)
but no tthe crisp that is the bad obsidian (deathrain) not here antizeal
the dark starchy sparkly stuff
or easy circuitry for drafting memory or function relays (it can help make easy battery pack)
an example of an infusion station works with schematic program
this will use raw material per formula or command sets (it counts as the TAX-APPROPRIATION)/WASTED ENERGY/QUO and creates byproduct of the proccess(cleaning up its own pollution)
10
this can be used as a turbine space to help resources assisted workloads
and can be used to detect obstructions etc
this can be install for a house and then later a nether reactor
this helps adjust the refresh rate for data in Mcells
this miniaux is helpful for cell-memory performance
useful for aux supply
a basic battery tapping draft with minuimal t-sector applied
uses a niutrous mix where aux may use standard salt-cel
SODIUM CELL or Salt-Cell must be recharged sometimes in SSD
auxcells risk overcharing and should be set correctively (adjust to load)
nitrous may use emerald powerpacks to recharge easier
but doesnt really if is already under sustained power stoerages
nitrous is a self-charging blossom based power cell
This helps with rfresh rate and charge calibrations
auto-insulation is very helpful in frequency adjustments
ITS JUST A LITERAL TRANSISTOR/DELAY
and or form a mini-rmeote or keypass or entry pass (onboardGATEFOB)
minoir components can be switched out as necessary
Standard Memory Cell that can be Fulcrum Tapped (recharged exchangable portable swappable)
A tapping station fulcrums memory using programmed arrangements
11
The goalie console release (THIS CREATES THE FIRST ITEMPREP-METAPACK-DATACHIP RELEASE LOOP)--now for the other loops within this same thing)
----but technically its good with just this loop (the last loops refer to multiloops and multiprocessing)
12
This is called a station rack and is used in server farms
this can hold at least two or maybe even 1 per level at mininum
Most Racks considt of a memory/auxtap or a function tap
can also be attached to an operation shelf such as aturret (or support a full loop release)
this will automate turret activity and using a netmesh protect
a netmesh is a sustained key-passe that keep u safe
this turret base can be used in amining defense salving etc
and used as drones as well or in compact use for mobility (COMPARE TO DROPPING AN AUOTMATED CAREPACKAGE)
13
A netherskate for a nether reactor can be racked (basically its a lockpin/pallete)
14
TrackSwitch Turn Press hatch-rotary for Assembly Line
This can help harvest from nether reactor (it keeps things moving and picks up and puts things onto a track and into positions (it is basically the arm of the turntable with its needlepin picking up/hooking things together)----HOORAY FOR HOOKS
it also has a turning safety and latch safety so you know it wont drop shit
15
THE OUTER SHELL OF THE WHOLE MODULE SITS AND WAITS TO ABSORB SIGNAL FROM THE -RELAY HEADER of the XTURBINE for the nexus
-----

----DROP DOWN:Data-Prepper/NetherReactor
This is basically the PLLC which i compare to a DATAFRYER
it has the PLLC next to a "GreasePan" for data on cooldown awaiting pickup/absorption to the above 15piece module
---
THIS MODULE has 5 parts and its last part acting as a "radiator" (the radiator radiates the waveforms to the "previous 15 piece connection "meta module full of those subprocesses") --its really just a work of art this thing anyways.
FIRSTHALF:
A////
left cooler/radiator
Left Vacous Steam Chamber/ Fulcrum based Piston
residual alchemy for that blue glue
power piston torquering ring
power piston housing/ module/engine/core 1234
piston passes through electro magnet and makes power, power charges into stream engine to reset positrac and shift press (data is getting steamed/streamed now)
pressure is passed thru and heat is retained into exhaust pipe
ehxaust pipe captures steam and grease and redistributes side//
side 1 is going down when side 2 is going up etc
while the piston is hammering out pressure
4 types of pwr thru pressure/steam/heat/electromag
right vacous steam pressure-fulcrum piston
then used to help formulate grease to make even easiert
grease used enhanced hydrolysis electrolysis L/R this alternates as pressure is built up and piston is pumped with that as the fuel-process
the right side radiator/ cooler
---then it dumps it into the grease pan as a massive vapour-seal
B////
ELECTROLYSIS LEFT//Alternative Support press Towers are Hybrigraphed//fulcrum based left::cell lever based right//HYDROLYSIS RIGHT
C////
1:3x system + 1:3x support system = hybrichimer
this suggest that might be chimergraphed as well as hybri
with insulation pillars of HYDRO-Electrolysis and Grease Grate(DUMP_)
=====
SECONDHALF:
The Grease Pan:Heating Transfer Grease Grate/ Retains Heat/ Steampressure Power/Alternates Heat Coil to Charge power Piston
And connects to its massive Radiation Unit
this 3 systems (main first half/connector/second half greasepan)
convey of a t-annihilation
tablet(paneling aka office tablet)
systemic moddedsystemic +header+powerguard
timebomh(defuse)
bignuke(dontset)--thenukle
the warex
and a bad indexing
--
with plancking chosenign homersque orimagmiesque (band-base encoding
something like having matrices but the bad ends//
includ a timeshare attack (shrapnelize fragment etc)
ORANGE GLASS FILTER
magnifique!
===
THENEXUS-LIGHTAUX-XTURBINE
its like any auxilliary, but itself is shielded in a massive dust chamber /diffusion space (static generator/dynamo chamber)
and is mostly made out wires that get super heated and form a plasmic pulse (this happens alot and very fast...it makes the whole procces from this all the way through the modules into the RAM---or ABS depending on what needs to be done
---
SIDE NOTES ABOUT AGGREGATION:
Top Layer for assignments/lock/Programkills/aborts using dowsing and the like
updated 9.8.2022
keeping this in because reference but also updated
due to drop tier anima redistrubte in transfer (sudden wiping)---this is  believed to be a conversion issue with faction/symbiote relatiosn and it retaliating or simply refusing to cooperate in its data-processing due to it being viral
now it can be re-coordinate to system they are tracking table
called a SACMAC 9/8/2022
not depicted but was not made options until sys-updated
the SACMAC will be a lightning rail that handles guass yet again
i guess we can make a green glass wall diffuse
now it will sac any trasnfer type blossom/etc exol/compact
==THIS ASSUME CONTIGUITY IS CORRECTLY APPLIED==
and shockmnodes and regular sequence breaker which is 5 total
plus tboxed it all up with the bars here
so it can do a raintap or area-dynamo statis checksum----(IT RAINS PROGRAMMED CODE NOW)
this allows for a range deguasser (rep work) instead of a bar

OK SO I HOPE I DIDNT MISS ANYTHING THERE---sometimes the signs themselves act as a macro-layout but i pretty much just need them there, not necessarily in order though sometimes that matters, just sort the information you have here out as a STEPBYSTEP MACRO of it in action in someway.
also note the filters pass in this as ORANGE to GREEN --but the write up was in drop-down (so everything is backwards---it just works fast when it needs to get SLAMMED OUT this way)--

--side note i can even fit a surge protector on top of this area
(the aux is ended with its fitting and receptor for the data feed through the analog connection onboard its entry header--starting up the full circuit with its intake/uptake of network data/onboard power (this indicates the PLUGIN SPACE FOR THE SECBAR)

***THAT EXPLAINS THE FILE PROCESS Now read those modules ALL BACKWARDS and that explains the refinment of any energy/data/file/info aggregated on circuit. (holy shit)
it also connects to a sec bar which basically just explains what that data is before it is entered at all into the system whatsoever for survey
the sec bar shows A SENTRY/BUNKER-MINES-DECOYS/DATASHUFFLE/TANK/TOWER/(STRAIGHT UP TIMEBOMB POWER DATA)

THE PLUG IN SPACE ALSO HAS (ABS PHASES 1 2 3 4 and assumably 5 or wholy of 6 combined phases)- and a POWERBYTE/DATA-ASSET SELECTION SYSTEM SIMILAR TO THAT OF A "vice with a container" being squeleched/squeeged/squeezed/switched/swapped with a "spring base and adjusted power delivery "popping assets into place) 
---its dr suess'ed/willy wonka'd beyond believe but there you have it.

im going to have to explain all these parts  too....OH GOD THIS SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!! (screams and seethes intenrally)--why didnt i just write all this out before on paper! (oh wait i would have alt tabbed and ruining the thinking process...so JEEZ WHY ARE THERE SO MUCH THINGS TO EXPLAIN)
there are slides and signs everywhere, i can feel it in my VEINS (JEEEZUS THIS IS GONNA SUCK)

oh look at my security SQUIGGLER machine, all its squiggles have to be explained and in EVERYSTEP (AGAIN!!)---oh my crapping lord 
it wont ever happen in time ( i guess i will keep all the secrets to myself until i can find someway to do this)---its an absolute CRAWL (i thought it would get easier but this is the most thick of it im at right now...with 30k slides to go. more or less....face melting to look at)--even with all the meds and relaxing music in the world. FFS. i cant do this and its so much just a one man project im stuck and this is so dumb...gpte wont even code half this crap the way i have it wrote up. IM SCREWED. lol.. omg dood whyyyyyyyy. I feel like this has aged me 20 years.
