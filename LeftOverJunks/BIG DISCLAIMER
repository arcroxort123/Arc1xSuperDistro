This is just a junk collection of undeveloped snippets/code-to-be
Over the course of the document I added in MANY LINKS
some are broken or refer to information already Provided in this Collection.

There are links to:
A minecraft map. To get this to work you have to load it into a minecraft-MAP-folder. Because I ripped it directly out of mine. It's the whole LEGACY project up to the end of virtual LEGACY with some extra stuff but not much. (Most of the EXTRAS is included in there)--however I did not tweak the build as in REFERENCES.
There are some YOUTUBE links demonstrating the MINECRAFT MAP. Which you can play.
A small GPTE project with all the text/advanced builds turned to an asset-folder. This project is made by gpte being fed the document at 50 lines or so, under a single pass. It ended up costing me 50 bucks and is just a joke IMO. It currently does freakin NOTHING. But you can see what it did.
There is ACTUAL LINUX PACKAGES LISTED TOO. These mean nothing and I just threw them all together based off what I found off the net, and maybe some selection. RUBY/PIP/NODE/VS-studio and OTHERS. You can more or less download these in some way and automate their installs in some way. I did not include the ways to do this.
Just look up how to make these work for you. THE FILES ARE AS IS and my FILES and my PROJECTFILES are as is. I dont know shit about coding. I want to but I cant. And it took me 6 years+ to assemble all this data, if its ALL JUST BULLSHIT then thats what it is.
Dont think I have a secret working system underground bunker because I just dont have any money/possible way actually. I live by myself and my rescue cat.
IF YOU READ ANYTHING you may notice I REPEAT MYSELF. In my Extras-Document I actually DID infact repeat myself by accident, and That WHOLE repeat gets reconverted to a business-district-socket to place the DRAGON-BEHEMOTH/LOIC as the final module. (This empiracilizes the economy.) Pretty luck how that just matches together. nice and neat (even if it doesnt seem that way) It beocmes a massive skunkworks-production able to create full-products with entire meta-builds. It just makes sense that way and all my mistakes seem to actually work out.
