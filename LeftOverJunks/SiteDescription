Now that the software and building schematics are mostly in place this will look like a megafab or "nuclear-power site".

What this starts up with, how it ends the way it is, and what it looks like in the final stages I will describe in short detail here. Based off an accelerated jump start of the buildings/factories/modules/articles in use.
So without further aduie i guess:

We start off on making a power-engine/device. For instance a magnetic engine. This delivers power that can be set to a battery.
The battery chain follows that a recieving battery is given primary, and relays to a storage battery, and that storage battery is in drain to or by a distributive battery. This follows basically the battery chain, and can be connected with conduit.
This builds up to a sluice/dredge/sledge/recycling plant which takes in trash and assorts it and refines what may into alloy plating for on call resources and printing/charging for energy/power/data/source distrubtions.
This is all set to a reactor/forge system in which it smelts everything, and throws out byproduct. Meanwhile there is a mining rig that is carving out a lot of resources which are transported also to add into the mix, and this is also given to a chemical plant if necessary once processing is made.
Simply put this is the main resource/crude resources involved over a factory chain and processing-plant.
There are also a computational-rigging to allow for opsec/programming necessary to automate this, as well as robotics involved, this can achieved quickly, but takes time to dig a hole and fill it with trash, this can be made into a bunker.
This looks like a heavy-industrialized sector, there is also a packaging plant if necessary to distribute these goods to where they are needed in construction.

This process is later purified through refined products over a security sweep to for safe handling/shipping over logistics, and this includes digital logistics, but largely are making programmed batteries for catalogue and analysis over analog and input through server, for which it is programmed and refined based off the software we developed.
This is then sent to a meta-chain/training/fieldtest and the secured for a beta-test in a public-environment, then is calibrated for assortment over an ai-tract.
These batteries are then applied to a reactor system in thermal-rails, and handled for more dynamic-data/power processing and sent to opsec for robitic-integration afterwards, this follows up with vox-detail and the whole process is called the rail.
Due to upgrades this can iron dome once this cycle is completely achieved in automation.

A secondary assistant rail-line known as the prosper maintains all needs and logistics in automation to conduct a launch site and virtualization of remote-operations.
This allows cluster use as well over time can establish many secondary-offsite operations through which increase complexity of the mega-fab. But upgrades with the software in its many patch-ups.
