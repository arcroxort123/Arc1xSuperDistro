UNLISTED WORK
(I did not include ANY OF THIS, take from it as you will)---this includes works i have not been able to submit or otherwise have with-held in all honesty. DUE to personal reason but I think its important to note that they exist. Some of them, in my opinion, may be necessary. BUT IM ALSO just plain UNDECIDED to do with what I have, because I haven't spared the time to review for them until now,
These works make up for certain utilties that were not explained that should be. And in fact, these are personalized so I might not explain them but I will mention their importantance. Of which there are several things. But amounting to mostly optional side-notes.
SO I MAY OR MAY NOT INCLUDE these, and let's be honest, it really doesn't matter what I do because Nothing I have submitted is that phenomenol. I wish someone would sponsor me though. 
TBH only a few ideas here and there, the rest is just a suitcase full of crazy madman/tv-fanboyism writings I don't particularly like and just wanted to get out of my brain.

This COLLECTION involves DEPICTING ---WORLDTERRAIN/RESIDENCES/INHABITANTS/COMMON-PRACTICES/OFFICIAL-SERVICES/PROFESSIONS/TOOLS/POPULATION-AND-PROPOGATION-ADVICES/TECHNOLOGICAL-TIPS-AND-TRICKS/SECURITY-GUIDES
This also has some artwork/lorecrafting involved, as to why its personalized, but the overall personalization can be used by others too if needed. Specifically New-Users.
