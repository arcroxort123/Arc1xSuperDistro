UNLISTED WORK
(I did not include ANY OF THIS, take from it as you will)
These works make up for certain utilties that were not explained that should be. And in fact, these are personalized so I might not explain them but I will mention their importantance. Of which there are several things. But amounting to mostly optional side-notes.

This COLLECTION involves DEPICTING ---WORLDTERRAIN/RESIDENCES/INHABITANTS/COMMON-PRACTICES/OFFICIAL-SERVICES/PROFESSIONS/TOOLS/POPULATION-AND-PROPOGATION-ADVICES/TECHNOLOGICAL-TIPS-AND-TRICKS/SECURITY-GUIDES
This also has some artwork/lorecrafting involved, as to why its personalized, but the overall personalization can be used by others too if needed. Specifically New-Users.
