Program/Gui and User-Kit

---(user-folder/file) --pathway/pathologic (OutFit Active/Base)
User is assigned account under privileges
Account is granted access to character creation.
A mech is assigned designated per character profile.
Decorations and Xnav are applied for Mech/User command/experiences.

---(default/custom runtime image) (OutFit Modes/Swaps)
Tutorial of Operations
User is granted access to base/basic default or privilege profiles
Workspace Interfaces are adjusted per profile/xpref and defaults.
User may submit prompt/general contract/performance

---(loadouts/realm-optimization) (OutFit Store/Detail)
A datascrap/collection is processed and compatibility-checked.
UserEnd-SourceProfile/Networking(masks) and ServerSide-"Code-write/mesh"/Resources/Data/Meta-types are evaluated/profiled to Xprefs/user-Specs
Dowsing/Dosing may take place to accomadate matchbases and interactions with/without rulesets/behavoirs.
Markets/Method (Action Strings) / Surface Security/Catalogues and Set-Xtact/stereographic-(cat/cab) to read/print Queue/Edition "Key/Credit frame" --Adaptive-Sample (Payload/Transaction)

---conditions and follow ups /special cases including QOL/EOA(quality of life / ease of access) (OutFit Assigns/Fittings)
Plugins / Extensions / Macros / Scripts may be applied.
Sourcing and Brokering Takes place over Network connections and Bridgepoints assigned.
CharacterParams are re-distributed through Services per Request (TableUsage of Region)/Config or "expecation/as is"

---Nutopian-Beacon/Visory-AutocCommit (dataflow and memetics) (OutFit Latents/Memetics)
WorldGeneration/CharacterGeneration may be Set To Server-Event and Allowed-Entry per Cluster/Convention or Draft-Select(Where Granted)---Environment/Container
Workspace---Codec/Codex/Codon/Index/Encode/Asset Requests/Contracts and Gameplay/Debug Performances may be set to Account/Character and Applicable Runtimes through Mod-Settings and Realm-Details/Chunk-Heaps (for sync/tray management)
Clerical Constraints may be Negotitated alongside Gm-Routine----(user ticketing)
Blacksite/blackbox ID-chain is assigned and non-transferable by SERVER-Covenant and Exists between terms/policy as standard express/function of System-Services (which is compliant and adherent to system-only interactions)---System InfoSec/Security-Clearences and is native/local to SYSTEM and reserved for SYSTEM-distribution/cluster only. And datalocked/vault by User-matchbase(assigned by system/signature algorithmic-encrypture) ---"NFT/Tags"
Anim/Akira Flux-Transfer by Stack/Active Sim/Bit/Sig/Pin and Void/Survey/Vox/Rift/Option/Lense (generally Dev-TTY) and Screen-Summary (and MainScreen)

So basically to me this is an IDE that "is all-in-one" its easier described as a Photoshop/AfterEffects (but for things like AI/Blender and Rigging for Mocaps/User-Gestures) ---should be automatic (the User-Kit then assembles/compiles everything under CURRENT-Project and it is integrated as needed)---"automatic-character detailing"/trained-nuvolution. (And this includes live-action normalization/customizations over a stable-default)
So a memetic-autoloader that just "guesses what things are supposed look like" and auto-fixes anything like a CONTROL-NET
Any further fix/patch ups needed to correct/streamline mass-production/constants of Model/Lang.

look...i'm just describing something that should already exist and rationalizing it the best way i can.
"Cue super powers" and RNG-Code-sluething
