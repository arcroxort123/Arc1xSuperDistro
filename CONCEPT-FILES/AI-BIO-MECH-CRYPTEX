AI-BIO-MECH-CRYPTEX

SINCE the Start of Legacy certain code-forms had been slightly pronounced to resemble biological-components and for that I feel now that the system has been fully worked out we can 'flesh' these components out as per what they were used or regarded as during development, into a fully assembled "encrypted cellular structure" or at least the metric of one.
For simulation purposes (but that is how it all starts out anyway)

In the very early stages of the project when developing the Nexus, it was Evident that certain components resembled biological factors.
I will try my best to remember and describe them and even timestamp them somewhat.

The first instances were a porous/lysosome like vacuole based quotient for which seemingly adapted for multiple uses and components, and would later develop to an OPTION set, as the best way to describe it. It would also pronounce itself as a POSTPONE for refined Option-Sets and in Hard-tact.
There were others prior to this, but they were slightly off project.
----
Those others were a cellular-membrane that resembled a segmented worm, and its purpose was more of a discarded-covering/swatch that was LARGELY AVOIDED because of superstition, and I think reasonably so because it was difficult to manage. It was seemingly starch-like.
This lead to the salt-like/sugar-like structures and later would develop into alchemy/gemetric performances and would need to be "complexed and grouped" to consolidate the rampant amount/abundance for which these would cause much interference in development due to lack of understanding/apparent-usage at the time.
Protein-isomers were also developed which starngely coinsided with the fad/craze use of MRNA but not for the purposes for which they were so 'famous' for. We were trying to correlate anything/random appearences of these to a code or encode, and had no idea what to make of anything except not to disturb/disrupt it and avoid it. Especially if it was not topical to the development. But they were noted.
This led to the idea of WADS/other file types used to deploy fast-encodes based on raw-packets. it was sketchy territory and largely i had no idea what I was doing, just trying to keep it all in a box and feasibly within reason as to why I would notice this thing at all. (I learned of some history of this and knew that it might be important to be very careful with these code-forms as I call them)
-----
Even before the "worm structures" there was the case for a "thermal shielding but this was developed as a hodge podge of geometrical-discarded code-forms that would make a somewhat "recognizable and orderly shape like a rectangle"--this would later be refined into melds/flyers and sometimes clusters in philosophical-strucutures and code-forms. Their performances were hinted at being somewhat meta-like and having intrinsic properties based on their compile. But what can you expect with just "hodge-podge"/brick-brAC shapes.
Other shapes included BRICKS which were corrupt/inoperable in somewhat magnetic/unified to which would need further tech/analysis to resume/assume their structure and adjustments. For which of course were understand as something to avoid due to the nature of electronic-haywires/system-shocks. This lead to the idea of a shock/impact-insulation which started as a riser/platform and developed into a tensor. But that is a long story that is worked out in development.
-----
Even earlier were examples of "conduit channels and frequency paths" for which I had little understanding of and attempted to "route them" as one would expect pointA goes to PointB therefore it is a transformer/AND/OR thingy in electrical-computing, this would develop into logistics and signal-correalations and color-codes to help expedite these processes into something viable.
There were also cases for draft-boxes similar to what one would expect out of a skybox but largely barebones and un-compiled "empty shell". This developed to quasi-modes in conjunction with thermal shielding and also raw-chunks. Because their was widespread reference as to what many of these could be, it had to be focused and contained for my own FRAME-OF-MIND to keep it organized.
There were also a black-lightning and shock-like-spark/flare (what I also refer to as a PICKLE, in my own case of development, having PICKLES as what they are known, I could place the idea here to relate somewhat) which would become a limbic-packet (which is somewhat of a mental signal)---this was one of the very good combinations I found and was able to consolidate for other purposes. This just happened i guess from overloading my understandings of these potential components.
Sometimes words themselves became components, like potentia. And this would act as a quotient or reference item to a large or complex compile of conditional shapes/file-types I had envisioned (to further consolidate the process and expedite it into an orderly development.
It was obvious that words were becoming components and making themselves library/glossary of what they may be represented in terms of things. I would invent many words to accomdate what was expected or needed or "presumed feasibly possible" for these codeforms and put them into a designated use/pattern of grouping/complexing.
This turned out to work very well and these patterns largely followed the same path. And I was able to "abstract" alot of these into objects/code-forms that could be what I needed at the time or consider them for development as a code/script structure. It turns out, sometimes programs just ended up being made of shape-procedurated/concept-prodcedurated STRUCTURES and less actual scripts, but a series of shapes/color-codes I could understand.
I know there is a "learning condition" for this but that it what basically I was left to work out on my own. And I had enough of wandering through it aimlessly to make it what it ended up being, a large asset-table of variable concepts 'to get the ball-rolling'.
---
Before all that there were other concepts I would just call out as being something. Carl-code is a type of code that is strained and unnecessary to me, but I feel might exist in some "accent/italic" nature to a codebase. Sometimes it just becomes obvious that in measure, carl-code just is just a random thing that may be.
Yolo-code is some very advanced and final code for which I would consider to be "alien-like" or "nuclear-like" and that includes channels and their frequencies, for which I would just set to the side instead of investigate as to "keep on track to my own developing codes".
----
Because of quasi-mode I noticed that there may be "molecular"-arms/bridges connecting other quasi-modes and that would sort of become a variant of carl-codes/yolo-codes for which would require FURTHER development than what i had at the time, but was largely acceptable to leave 'as is' in terms of having a 'very complex strucutre' in comparison to a basic-structure.
Would update as needed---but these molecular-arms/bridges would later become very very useful. For now they were referred to as just a molecular structure.
But there would be other things such as extensions, that would imply those structures have been repurposed in some way. And that led to the theorizing of plugins and droplets and other things that would seemingly be able to fit these extensions and or purpose as.

So there are sometimes a backstory to components and how they came to be theorized.
There would also be things I would notice in games that could follow these "properties"
One of the better ways was a yoshi-stone like thing, which to me would resemble a very pumice like-structure, and I would use this in one case, to be a stone-like-pumice structure that resembled an oval-with two holes on either side of it, used as the MOST PRIMITIVE SEQUENCER or conceptual-balancing-tool I could possible imagine. Infact, while it seemed obselete, this concept was sometimes even paramount to other early processes that would lead to advanced developments. I largely forgot about this later on though, but I feel i should attempt to bring it back as an easter egg. As its one of my very very few I seem to have understood.
Infact I had been sort of leaning on this particular ideal since around 2008 and so on. It just is so freaking useful ---(until you know how the mind snaps and people just have nothing to put a proper symbol on)
ANYWAYS...there were also conceptual levels and sometimes 'game-theory' concepts and such, I would branch them into as maybe, components that referenced highly-conceptual-states/figures such as a psyche-level which is an "scarcely used concept" but still it seemingly has its place, and would resemble a "whiteboard" that I would try to minimally-include into or as a flyer/packet of some type, that was heavily implied. (Just as how alot of other components resembled others, this one resembled hardtacts/sticky-forms which sometimes "blurred the lines of fuzzy logic" for me to make it difficult to explain their exact purpose/reference)--and would just be a clutch-system or temporary/fix.
This would also yield to crude/primitive fixes and which I could even theorize making "mechanical structures with" such as a pully system/elevator lever. This became a "drastically DAUNTING" task, but made its way to the advancement of auxilliary componments such as a dynamo/hypercoil and other things that would "take their shape after being provable through a code-source".
So that is how code-structures would really begin to have their era.
