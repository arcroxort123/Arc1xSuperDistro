I want to this to work, but I might have to code all the other stuff for it to also work. heh.

I spent a few days getting AUTOGPT to work on a "SCSI-expansion Drive that runs WINDOWS 11 and Ubuntu"---oh yes...its possible (even if it says it isn't) ;)

A Minecraft Gamespace with a Character that can communicate a fully coded script.
The character is going to create a township with multiple faceted workplaces catered to a specific vocation for computing. It will be consistent to a data partition for an operating system
The character will exchange various marketplace scripts for commodity usage of the township facilities. This will effect his journal and designate reccomended quest chains for his overall search.
Provide an example of a work order and transcript the event to assign a character's user experience. Virtualize this as an xscopy if necessary.
Grant a reward program. Update a framework to the character's userbase and model entry, match any assets by resolve of the overall index and record all performances in brokering.
(Optional):Use Networking and caretaking if necessary, consider other Users and NPC's as well. Including but not to passive actions/piracy/crypto-methods/rdxn(rdna)-paritition-writes/hard-tact-symlinks

Here is what it looks like. FIRST UP IS THE WHOLE PROMPT IN A CHUNK: (I will show what it looks like by line also)--I am a mess from being so tired so bear with me on my mistakes lol.
