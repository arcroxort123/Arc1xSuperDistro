Final Statement
THANK YOU FOR HOSTING/READING THIS PROJECT.

Developed as a Data-Processing-Chain/Manager (with alot of world-view/worldbuilding involved)

Developed in legacy with minecraft. Minecrat-Build-Provided in link.

Nevermind but...
A machine that is force-fed signals/data that then prints-out data recompiled for scripting/code-building using a server.
User-Case(commands) and real-time/real-world samples are refined from crude/elements/instructions and stored/used for power generation/survey. (Complex/Groups/Sequences/Chains may occur)
Distributed Samples/Survey are also assembled on their way to server.
uh..easier way to say this...


Original-Legacy-Build:
Machine-Based:
We build a machine in minecraft that takes junk/trash and refines it for battery/nuclear usage.
Read outs of samples/survey are converted into signals/data-packets and transferred over a circuit/adapter.
This is known as a machine/mech aux/turbine and is efficient enough to provide power/data for distribution/automation.
---
Computer-Based:
A server scripts/proccesses this data for programs/builds (like any other server does).
As well as for the interests of AI/Robotics with assisted-automation/distribution-services.
Logic-Routes/Networking is used to expedite this process.
Power is enhanced/Data is trained through files and security-chains are developed to ensure quality-control over remote transfer/exchange. Etc.
---
Logistics-based:
There is alot of code and stuff used to workaround big data-entry problems to keep the system secure/reliable.
Automatic and Departmentalized Components for the Operating System is scratched together and "developed" in a progressive/prioritized on-demand.
Theory Crafting and Virtual-GameSpace is devised using the Server/Operating-System/Other-Components which become subsidized overtime. Departments are assigned and vocationalized and optimized and sequenced for mass-production.
---
Large Parse/Cluster Based:
Levels and Intensive performances are developed for an increasing demand of range/flexible usages.
Programming and Security is enhanced for analog/virtual data-chains and AI-incorporation.
Interactive networking in Remote-Ai-Environmental-Survey is pioneered for Data/Power Formulas and Express-Conversion of Languages for system-adaptive-learning and AI-model-training.

This summs up legacy.

Virtual-Legacy-Build
---
We incorporate virtual-legacy with virtualized-relay and interactive-gamespaces. This is alot of common sense but had to cover alot of ground in terms of what is availible for that system to encompass.
So we account for psuedo-sciences/exotic-theories too.
This involved all of the hardware/software being finalized in an optimum/minimal package/product. (Which ends up being a virtual-equipment/computer-system Studio/pilot-stationary-arcade or even a pilotable-drone etc)
---just performing the rounds of what was considered feasible by the system with some consideration for fringe-science etc.
------

The whole development for me was lifechanging in a way, so I decide to put it up what I have on github and then get better ideas because inspiration was still going.

Text Builds
---Made the "REPO" ---to try to consolidate everything into an architecture for a CPU all-in-one automatic-interpretation of Legacy/Virtual-Legacy.---Suggested Drone-Networking-Systems
---Made the "Distro" ---a better version of REPO with more theory/ai markup.---Suggested Drone-Tower-Control-Systems
---Included the original legacy/virtual builds with additional AI-THEORY/AI-BRAIN protocol to work with REPO/DISTRO as well.---Suggested More Advanced Particle-Systems
---Ai Systems known as NUAIRX and its Expo/Virtual-Decks to make things easier.
---Developed the idea of the Bulkhead (a way to make this even more complete/integral ---Suggested Fully-Compartmentalized-Builds)
---Developed a Dyson-Tamper (A large-particle-network and centrifuge-tower that operates remotely and safely for intensive-data-automation)
---other stuff like "deepcase" and policy.

Advanced Builds
---Considered for Quantum-Application and Dcore(or the core that we also had built thus far) with Quantum-Architecture
---deepcase advances to "Blacksite" usage
---There is a Triage/"Conjunction/Fork" 1)Ai-Bumper that processes all data-chains/networking and has 2)its own Security-Scanning and 3)Express-Manangement-Logic-Chain
---Update this "Triage" for "particle management/massive theory crafting" in mass-productive-uncertainty/ruleset concerns of counter-programming.
---"Quarter" and finalized as a massive attempt to commandeer blacksite/viral vulnerabilities and fortify the system and AI.
---Blacksite data becomes updated with Spectralite/Sprite systems (exo/fountain systems--its just a mess of encrypted quantum data/particles)

Extras Builds
---
Things I didn't mention that I really should have mentioned but ended up revisisting and updating the for above
REFERENCES are appendixes in which all those things have been put together in a finalized-suggested build---this became so complicated because it involved everything being updated to current-editions.
---A meta-turbine is developed for Meta-data (data that isnt particularly used and therefore considered "up for grabs" under very delicate/sensitive conditions)
---A federation-brokering program is suggested as to incorporate NODESTACKS/subclusters/
---Meta-data becomes upgraded too. (Technically Meta-Decks are needed to make things easier)
---Consideration of Rogues/Mercenary Data-Trains which are counter train----if this wasnt then it is now at least mentioned here.
---Dragon/Titan/Quasi-Chapter sort of becomes a thing to handle all these extra problems.
---OTHER WEIRD THINGS LIKE "AI-BRAIN-RESETS and REM issues became incorporated"---im glad it was but it was complicated at times. (There are alot of even weirder things I just glossed over too but are in there somewhere)
---Considering incorporating a CARDINAL-QUASI-COMPASS system but I am not sure what this entails or implies as the term itself is oxymoronic. (Probably using advanced fuel and a tokamac over viral-conscript/protections)
