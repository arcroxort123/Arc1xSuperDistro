DISCLAIMER
THIS ENTIRE SET-DOCUMENT IS BASICALLY AN OPTIONAL PACKAGE (and not necessary for an operation)--this is the *(delux packaging so to speak)
The following particular section may involve an SCP-CONTAINMENT-PROCESS to occur within SIMULATION(character-data at stake)
(allowed evacuation but strictly under escort and full co-operation--there is no avoiding this if this occurs--it will require RELOCATION during an OUTBREAK and definitely not a drill)
The other side of this coin is that there may be a SPY-GAME taking place with ID-THIEVES and ESPIONAGE (this is a legitmate proxy-cycle that cannot be avoided)--and requires continuous relocation (NOMADIC COMPLIANCE)
Alright you will just have to figure out what that means if you are involved (Basically you are in a free-agent standing under an outbreak/green peace clause)--with your data being at risk if you are simply NON-COOPERATIVE/Violating UserCOMPLIANCE
Basically you will have to "escape the maze" type situation or "survive the game of TAG" situation if you are somehow involved in this EVENT-(Which occurs on SIM and will basically "cause your information to be at risk" if that is the case.
This is all INTENDED TO BE -REMOTE ACCESS ONLY (for safety reasons)--I am just saying this now, during development some things happened to make this a concern BECAUSE of the nature of "ai controller issues"--Which simply means "rogue AI"
This more or less shows how to DEVELOP the rogueAI and handle and contain the rogueAI outbreak (which likely is to occur upon completion of its development)
This is a full security disclosure of the operandi and general drill-practices involved during the ROGUE-EVENT that actually does take place and actually is somewhat of a system-hueristic-threat.
The Hueristic Threat Level follows defcon, and is not activated until the entire completion of the document for which is fully described and the "ALLLOWED-GREENPEACE-EVACUATION-PROCEDURE that is described". 
(This protects user data that is put at risk if followed properly.)

Also we introduce a thing called the XNAV(charter-pallete)--which has three layers of accessibility (Debut/Advanced/Ultimate)
It simply Maps and allows Shortcuts (the shortcuts are pretty good)
The Debut model has ports between tiers/relms and Full-Survey-Capability (automatic mapping) (assisted nexus memetic)
The Advanced Model has active-vector(hostile) management and SAP Routing (isolated mapping) (assisted azoc-memetics)
The Ultimate model has Live-Interactive-Threat-Analysis and Escape-Routing (infiltrative mapping via ai-dithering and azoc-memetics)--using ddr6 and all other ddr versions/compatible memory-assets (Wow WTG!)

******************************************************************************************
The Full Dyson Construct (ExoNav)
******************************************************************************************

Part 1 Dyson-Vrx-Platform (Upgrading the Legacy: Rail and Prosper and Region) + (NuAIRx) to the Dyson-Vrx-Engine Etc) as "Nu-Region"
Dyson Rail:(A)
Shortcut "Tunnel"/Runway System
Partition Space Dedicated for Fast Tracking File-Generation (Incorporated to a Dyson Pod-Share Brief Simulation)
Works as a Remote-Live-Mail Fetch and Bulletin System (Quest Timer)
Acts as a Farewell-Negotiation (To a BonVoyage)/HelloWorld --FairwayLaunchProtocol of DeepSim/Xsynch with Xcode-Ejection
Full Emissionary Detailer - Ricochet-Rebound xSplasher (Buffering Service)

Dyson Prosper "WorkPoint":(B)
Applies a Nu-Assortment Code Inject (Hyper-Railed)/Accelerated
Runs off main rail assortment to meta-prosper-assortment (joint operative)

Performs Class Priority Data Sweep (Specialized Preset/Macro Allocation)
Class-Template Prioritization to Class Template Prioritization --Reverse-Compatibility of hardwire Version (Specialized Firmware-Subtract)-Applicator
(Low Impact - Full Dive / Fulton / LiftOff) Multi-Selection and Preferential Profiling (Specialized Search Indexing)

Part 2 (Applying A Reactor Augment // Acting as Extension to a Working Dyson-Platform) -- (Dyson Server Casing and Header for Deep Sim Data Exchange "Dyson Runtime Network")
Dyson Component Region-Locker (similar to f-layer on region built for dyson):(C)
Model-Suggestive Preset and Itemization of Request/Contract (Inventorial Negotiation) - Imperitive CheckSystem
Dyson-Augmented-Reactor (Very nice) + System Life-Support + (System Directory Organizer and Firmware Compatibility List)
Works in Tandem with (A)(B) and StandAlone as (C)--best to have all cylinders.

Part 3 (Part1+Part2)
Real Time Exchange Service of Contract-Custom-Dyson-Sim "World Seed" Aggregate-Access

Almost Forgot to put this into the document of Part 3
Is better to have a dedicated Reactor handle this Extension or at least a Main-Central-Nexus
Optional Easy Case-Extension-Adapter for Tap/Vpn and Interception-Via-DataDistellation (5th Chain Data Model) --Can be Turned Off/On (Works with Data-Inteceptor and Network-Stackable)
--"Dilutes Data into Packet Chunks for Reassembly after Quantum Teleportation" and Recompiles based on Build-Protocols Of Site-Transcode (Based on Credential Api-Secure Usage) --or something.
Translates 3rd Party or Affiliate/Partnered Trusted Information into a Clear-Access-Framework (which then acts as Central HUD)--for all information transfer (informative filters or protocol-operandi)
With Bypass Strict to Pipeline Priority (Preferential Data-Feed) Uses Lots of CPU+RAM (OVERCLOCKED or TURBO) it uses most and more than all usually VirtualRAM and Availible Ram (Full OVERHAUL) which should be mitigated by Network Dataflow-Limits (Pref-Buffering)
Similar to SD-Options (And Attention Preferences to DataLoads) --Can cause system hangs (Usually Choppy Stream But can be fixed if dedicated and "untampered" connection is mostly streamlined for this particular process 
(server-distrubted data-feeding)--think of it like tightening suspensions until they are more or less over-loaded and pop off but allows to cheat weight limits. It can be throttled to avoid detection (which will sometimes autokick a connection
therefore connections must be also -reconnected)--once it clears up it can be "auto adjusted" under known stressors (within acceptence or exemption) --it will then still maybe cause a system hang or (fast rejection due to exception being recognized)--if this occurs it can be default to normal speeds
That is why its optional (it isnt necessary to have this extension to utilize aggregate-access)--it just helps if the system is allowed to over-ride "third party limitations" by supplementing its own capability. (Other systems might not allow this due to permissions or securityissues)--IDK 
(It would take even more hacking to see if it would work afterwards anyways)--It doesnt always work because "obselete tech" or incompatibility or just plain "unable to compensate for this "extrenuated stress on a dataload"
It should actually be called SERVER-HUSTLING --imo that describes the kind of situation taking place.
---
We have an expected packet, we want to have it instantly, we want the packet to be as large as possible to reduce the request and speed things up---naturally other technology will not be able to take this into account and "desynch" or trigger a flag or something.
Unless it can then it will be instantly siphoned as much as possible per the request issued. See what I am saying? Oh well. It would basically "transport entire fleets worth of information at a time or basically a full space colony to instanteously be teleported if for instance, a world-ending situation occured or system freeze :P"
"Even my own computer can't do this "atleast 10% of the time anyway" 90% of the time it crashes on a game load while running this entire thing (Comparitively this entire thing I can run on my computer, plus just this little part here can crash my computer)
so of course I would reccomend an actual server setup for this (I run my poor computer like a server would be run lol i.e. Don't do that!)
So a server should be good enough for doing this.

Now we get to count back all the times we would have used the "data distellery". So of course we would use it here at the very end.
We would use also at the start of the interceptor development (if we had even known about it--protip:we did)
because we wanted to use it way way back during legacy--sometime during the extras-development (still writing that out right now)
So we know there are those three parts we can use it with. Somewhere In Legacy/Extras/and with the RUNWAY / + "and all the little places any time there would be data used anywhere"--which is EVERYWHERE ELSE.
Using the distellery with THE ENTIRE SYSTEM--+using it with an interceptor WILL DEFINITELY require a fully dedicated nexus (for which THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT)--by the time we use it at all, we should be working towards finalizing the DYSON-REACTOR + DYSON PLATFORM (which it can be used with either)
Using it with the full system and the ENTIRITY of all its version is where it will work out best!
----So now we prioritize it by parses that it will handle (SPECIFIC parses or all of the ones possible)--this will cover hundreds of layers of server-hosted-processing over several trays/stacks. So now we can just use it all over "1U RACK" for instance and that should cover everything mentioned more or less. I assume anyway.
I PERSONALLY DONT OWN A SERVER OR A RACK FOR IT BUT IF I HAD ONE I WOULD BE GLAD TO INCORPORATE THIS SOMEHOW TO IT. hint hint wink wink nudge nudge.

Now we are taking alot of data from our own data milling and all our parses on every layer we can and mixing it into a commodified data-chunk (for DEEP-SIM immersion/projection) I don't know what to say. We can call it a NuDyson/Nuvolver-Tray because it will be hosting at least one LOADOUT of the "METACHUNK" it makes. (Actually several, infact they will all make a server/shard for a cluster if not enough by themselves)
And that would require alot of data-distrubtion which we have pipelined for express-exchange and secured it over the Data registery / DATABANK of all the account/contracts that it can be used  to host someone's game (like a minecraft host) if they wanted (A DEEP SIM HOSTING SERVIVCE)--that's where the moolah would be anyway. (And its kinda a big deal if infact they were streaming out that entire "relm/shard" it would need its policy-coverage.
If you absolutely have to provide a launcher for the bare necessities or minimum experience for (aggregate-access via a server host)--that would they allow them to interact as "A CUSTOMER WOULD EXPECT THEIR EXPEIRENCE TO BE IN ALL GENUINE REGARD TO THE SERVICE PROVIDED AS ADVERTISED"
IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO make an OFFER-PAGE for them to order it by.

AND JUST SO HAPPENS --we already would have designed a POLICY with the CONTRACT/ACCOUNT anyway and just section out exactly what that entails for "Hosting a Product/Server Chain" for instance so they could play a GAME/COLLAB/REMOTE-CONNECT at all. (Think like an E-ARENA)--and it would be acceptable under contract permissions and rates. (For which they likely have providied the costs for)--being that of which was assigned by their party-membership ETC. (Let's rank it like Standard/Deluxe Silver/Gold/Plat ETC) That kind of thing.
And then the server would dedicate the processing availibility of that (for instance if in a server farm)--would dedicate a server tray/rack to allot for the usage expected of the "event"/"contract"
Pretty Easy to Understand Nothing Complicated about that. It does not need to be any more complicated than that on the business 
I am saying, oh you will need such and such percentage of an availiable server, here you go//it costs this much, type sort of agreement. Would be the situation there (with policy and regional regulations that apply of course)
I feel like the system I am describing works, for those that have a server to use it they would apply my theories in this way (And it would be a nice way about it)------------unlike some -other unnamed services out there---my way of doing it would be fair as I have already shown this lays out like.


SO LET ME GET BACK TO THE DISTELLERY PARSE AVAILIBILITY WOULD BE EASIER DESCRIBED IN SUCH A WAY ON AN OFFER PAGE
To OFFER SERVICES BY PARSE OR TYPE.
That would likely involve the generic layout of the rail/prosper/region/platform etc all of that. Breaks down into a menu of sorts.
It is more recomennded to SELL BY WORLD-EDITION than anything. OR BY A 1U SERVER RACK for the WHOLE OF EVERYTHING
GOOD LUCK WITH THESE OFFERS ANYWAYS:

Sorted by Tier and major sectors and World Edition: 
For the Rail: (60 or so)
(Note the first 40 are the entire Nexus-barebones Setup and should be its own OFFER for start-ups)
(The full rail is 60 or so and should also be its own offer for better jumpstart)

For the Prosper:(45 or so)
(The first 15 or so are for Basic-Automated-Launch Site Development and Colonization)
(The Second 15 or so are for Genetic Lab Biome Production and Travel)
These can both be in their own package or together. (For Advanced Colonization)
(The Last 15 or so are strictly Data-Trafficing and also require large amounts of battery/power sourcing if not sustained by a reactor)

Now We are Done, but WAIT THERE'S Even MORE! (*Screams Internally) Here We Go Again (Lovable Snark)
***********
(*and I can't stress this enough, *muffled screaming internally*)-(Programming Broiling Plot Development)
--*(Are we still "screaming internally? dramaticpause-It Would appear so Yes")

Service Announcements (Openings or Allotments):
Taking a Step back. We can see the potential to Utilize this program to replicate other programs.
Taking a file-type, breaking it down to parameters, and emulating a workflow (seems like a simple transcode)--which can be replicated on a surface level.

Contract Order/Pre-Production:
We can take a file--and integrate prompt into the selection, to REVERSE-Engineer or Re-Design its Resulting Product.
We can simulate settings/selections/preferences/programming through transcripting the file-types at a surface level (designating parameters and establishing a mock-up of its workflow)
IT help to ARLEADY be able to transcode the file directly, and using known file-types the "deductive processes can be alleviated or assisted".

Procedure/Methods:
For instance we want to change a movie to include certain properties of a prompt-given-request. "I want this movie to be more Cartoon-like or its Characters to be different based on my own Profiles of "Cartoon Characters"
For instance I want to "Remaster the Movie to be designed as a "Matrix-Like Post-Apocalypse" or include "A Noire-Setting BackDrop" throughout selected scenes. (This would take some Effort, but can be done)
We would expedite this process in a variety of ways, and the user could select via a Test-Sample or Template of "Easy-Access-Modulations"
So there we go.
What I mean by "a variety of ways"--is that either it would snapshot the instance or given frame-by-frame and re-engineer it based on prompt and post-renditions at a "Surface Level" or it would Intensively Emulate certain Transcripts which it would detect or have primed for application.
This would be called LIQUIFIX/INTENSIVE LIQUIFIX. (Surface to Encode Level Transcripting)

The Manufacture Process:
Injection of XCode Likely Occurs Here:(PREP)
We would attempt a "Liquifix" transcode --See what works, See what methods can be used in combination and apply them based off User-Prompted/Preferential Scheduling.
The next stage (apparently there is a next stage)--would be to use that as a template for further Liquifixing.
Using these "novel methods" we can generate a Emulation of a workflow (in either way if it works to the desires of the user than GOOD)--the user could attempt to "enhance" results through a resolved "CHROSS-SYNCH" of their Workflow with other Workflows (or provided original workflow with "the redesigned workflow")
(A)Liquifix and (B)Chross-Synching (Would then work together after-images all auto-adjusted templates and parameters (OMG just....w/e) and replicate a new product.
Make Cartoon Movie Like "the Matrix" with "Noir Settings" and use "new Cast members based off this list" <--/A/<-->/B/--> with such and such other properties (Subtitles or Different Resolutions and other Impromptu Editing Choices)
Injection of XCode Likely Occurs Here:(DRAFT)
Prefaced for Deep SIm Use--Would Involve an Easy-Case Sampling (and so on) given or generated of a Base-Model/File-Type/WorkFlow. (In which to incur upon a World Seed or End-Product for Dyson-Construct Usage)---(OK)-(Express-Adaptive-Dyson-Profile)-EPG-EADP-(Reserve-Power-Depletions)-Turbine-PreReqs/Check

******************************************************************************************
The Bonus World and Quarantines
******************************************************************************************

11th World Edition
Standard Level Quarantine--Typical Defcon Initialized per Entry
Fully Realized Casing (interal region)
Dyson-Reactor + LightWaveToroid--SuperCollidor(particle-handling)--Super-ParticleABS-ExoDataLab
The Dyson Block(with reactors) can fit into a crimped-creased plasma-toroid (this is designed over the reactor/module space around the block) 
(It is very large already, and can allow what would be a gravity-normalizer if it were a space-station 
(basically is that operating as a plasma centrifuge fueled by the dyson and reactor power supply)--it also boosts power
The toroid may be stacked for all world tiers (Primal-Rem/Quantum-Virtual/Quasi-Crypto/Zero-Delemental ETC) 
Its worth at least 4stacks each would be 1U-Rack EACH Just for safety---(works with most comergent functions)--in 4 stacks (can be more or less depending on how its fashion--can include null-sec/info-sec/ai-sec/it-sec ETCX)
The toroid can be built wholly over an emplaced dyson as well (Functioning and fully integrated allowing for entrance to the dyson where necessary)-if necessary
It would appear as a buckyball/semi-geometric-cog being placed into a socket (designed and then operating within that would be the accelerations of the plasma-fields etc)-Like a collider around a WORLD CORE
Based on Xcodespace-Timespace in Flux of course---being comergent or shared (retroactive+spontaneity causualities)-achieves special-relativity in singularity (congruency lock-gates)--is primarily to lock and seal any potential hazard or dday 
Incorporates full quotient and polarized-usages (full transcommnication and teleportation within region) --Does well to achieve equilibrium through all power reserve and circuitry. (corrects multiplicity/conjecture and other Quantum Aux-issues)
*In maximum compact-capacity and fuel efficiency would be a square mile in size and height at least. Reducing Trafficing Cost from 10,000 to 1. Increasing Potential Travel Efficiency or power output in (Alot of Percents) Dyson Achieve Tokamatic-Supremacy (Maximum Capacity)
Achieves Delemetal Blume (if not yet already) and Circumvents REM strata. (Including Metro strata)- Can Bypass Various Stand Alone Modules and Solid States with Soveriegn Encode (Great Impunity)
Experiemental Orichalum Crystal Extract T8 Commodity and Food Additive (Full Replenish Full Nutritionally-Catered Timed-Release)

12/13/2023
Advanced Level Quarantine
Fully Realized Casing (outer region)
Dyson-Synapse-Central-Hub (Collider-Toroid)
Upgraded with a centrifuge (orichalum construct-casing)--full construct casing and compound-orchichalum dyson-marker
Complimentable with remote lair-wards and or sieged "integrated lair tensors" (multi-capital support) (Central Pallete "almost forgot to mention a new XNAV devpallete-already explained above" now with dyson carepackaging)
DistelleryWorks+Skunkworks=HiveWorks

TopLevel-Quarantine
Beta-ONLY EndGame-Character Upgrades for (May Require Reserve/Sustains or Upkeep to Maintain) -(this is what we were waiting for)
Version 2 of slueth/striker/stacker (party system of a medium,large,small) 1,2,3 whole system 
Dominant Rex-Enhanced-Exoform
Adapt to (Trascend/Reborn/Nuvolve Etc)-->Element(Padded)--Masked(tusked)--Hypnotic(SynthMod)--(better use of limit/mood) and equipped with Xcodec-Palletes (Better use of cracking/hijacking)
Can induce contingency (remote travel points) and (auxhole-navigation) without backup systems or relays necessary (because Xnav)
Also due to class-superiority a secondary overbearence and a secondary supporting build-(Agi/Dex/Str MainFocus/ Con/Int/Wis SubFocus)--can be inhibited and (work to insulate attack)--acting as a counter shield ---(basically has its own natural armor/magic armor built-in now) via (CHR/LUK based added-effect)
Exotic Decore - "Spikes/Quills/Horns/Claws/Scales/Patterns/Textures/Crests ETC all develop based on Ambience and Class/Builds" --Can be exchanged for a preferred Custom-Brand (Property Set)--is basically bio-engineering (Rebuild of a Custom Xcodon)--so thats just a test/experimental Condition of Evolved-xTypes
(and also why not a dark mode for dark-powers/ghosts/lanterns/lich/phantom based x-types as well)--or at least a special minion for them (Minions can perception check)--help with true-dodge/glancing/feinting/saving-throws (makes them more likely for you and less likely for opponents)--added protection from PRE-EMPTIVE/1st-Strikes
Also InWorld Conditions which may work as Bylaws/FactionRulesets that they can only use their "new talents" in Arena-Only or Private Settings --And Not Allowed to Do Much but Discuss in ONTOPIC-Forum/Board pertaining to their "Acquired Builds" under Official-Faction-TRUST and resulting Penalty if in Violation. :_) (not gonna argue why)
Here's why, because its a faction-moderated advancement and reserved for intial contracts that are under trusted-agreements (so YOUR OWN faction models or properties can't be basically stolen)---you're welcome.
There are other things but I know for a fact these are more likely (and are more backed by theory rather than nothing at all)
Also Minions can use fleet attacks if encharged--this means multi-minions/Swarms can be used alongside as wards too (auto-sentries)

Sleeper Level Quarantine
This next part involves End-Game Raiding and gets very hazardous to characters
The Upgraded Slueth/Strikers/Stackers also have counterparts in (Rivals Such as AI/Lair/Rex)--just to name a few (there are probably crimerings too or pirates)
(Xstrain):-Viral/Nerv/Toxic --(Node-Meta):Septic/Crypt/Corrupt --(ghost-script):Shock/Flash/Corrupt
These counter abilities are so bad. Infact, we know all of them but it is mostly for Physical/Digital/Paranormal
These things start out at 10th world but dont really attack until 11th world (They are so bad and honestly they scare me)

--The Best Strategy is: 
Construct Level Quarantine and Remote Command
A Titan Class Ship (with a fleet preferred and jump-rail too--as in arc's and colonies)--and their own Dreadnaughts (yes please) --both squads and fleets and titans all have dreadnaughts (these things are necessary)
This crap is so bad. It scared me and I am glad I have these ships. Hopefully they are automatic and produceable ASAP by now.
Use of an Active Patrol and Security Regional Sec (World Sec and System Sec)--to keep this from happening. Too late though it happened. and it's just like a very bad counter-op.
All of this "BS" actually happens alot. This is how to deal with it automatically now.
There are probably ways to handle it with VPN/Proxies and just every form of CPU Environment and Server Environment and CLINICALLY-STERILE-Server Farm and DataBase but you will eventually need to just evacuate if you don't have a full Army. Sorry.
Having a Faction Protecting you from this should be default (but sometimes it isn't) You might be good enough even with a simple 'Frigate' to outlive an incursion, who knows. I know, and I wouldn't feel comfortable with anything less than a battleship.
This Setup will help to survive Multiple Dday-Attacks. Well that will suck if even one goes off. It will be useful to at least handle a few of them.
Transfixed Compass (Integrated Mapping Compass with Mapping System)--may use nueral-grids as charters on mapping-profile and other charter profiles (ai-prompting charter for instance)--(ledger-charters)--(both those and workspace-related charter)--(modcharter)-(these charters together with a compass for a self-explorable charter base--on any level including dungeon level)
Allows "for bidding" contracts of charters (speaking of faction charter exchanges are forbidden)

Advanced Recognition "Profiles" Able to better 'recognize' item types such as the difference between a comparison card/mesh/node/bomb for isntance what the difference is between those or an advanced measure of an item property "corpse/chemical" : i.e. corpse-card/chemical-mesh and so on.
Advanced item-trees/stems "profiles" which mean compensated items or "very disguised items" can be built into and their profiles shared over other "pathways" via quick-call or etc between Seeds/Uuids

The profiles were getting xploited so there was a new xpad system to reduce this from occuring. The entire wpad usage has been upgraded to an xpad usage (which is an encrypted wpad)--most wpads are already encrpyted, this now encrypts it even further.
With a Wpad-->Xpad encryption using the Xnav capability and Xcodes that are now encrypted (as being normalized to regular encodes thru this process they can be assigned encryptions, even though xcodes are encrypted. So its not only doubly encrypted but doubly doubly so.)
So let me just say the timeline of this encryption and where it picks up from. The development of the dysonrelay/delemetael bouquets (back at the completion of the NuAirx Systems and SleeperMode)--picks up from there, goes over the bulkheads, goes over the biometric podspaces, and now the runway-DeepSim-Hiveworks etc. So it makes its own expanse in four parts.
Hopewfully this covers the marginal emplacemnts of all security efforts (the frameworks and where they begin and end over all the breakpoints involved)--and why its considered advanced and why there is a pallete for all of this now

Review (its backwards but it works okay this way)--(Devs Will only need to backtrack so far before situations based on severity/critical urgency etc)

Not sure if I should also add-on for an azone-adhoc-containment-cell
what inspired this is a clinically isolated environment
(and all the security effects of encryption) that owuld allow for an azoc after hiveworks(post-dyson-region)
So we can have it but does it really make it any better? Well that is debatble.
The best case is that there would be a pillar storage of empty-container-spaced-capsules/canisters or holding-stats or any thing that would need to retain its "Stand Alone" properties (as na isolated compartment or bulkhead)
I wanted it to be something anyway. The other thing is that of course we have a tier build of all modules and it takes its affairs and combative status with it. (Like a NoManSky-Base) imo but here's how ours works:

These can all be xpiloted(so thats fun)
1)We have the robotic-unit/goliath etc with its core-system (by now its a mini-collasus that acts as its own kernal) this is built into the frame and also has its appendages/armatures etc (and a functioning "headpiece" that would also likely lock into a socket for security.
2)This fits into a battle-deck or "field transport" we basically call it an xroller anyway (now it is carried if it must be)--this is a mobilehousing for it basically and all its add-ons (modules such as recharging etc)
3)that takes it to a larger vassel allowing for "flight" or a jetpack/tanking vassel
4)which goes to a sub for expeditionary (full excursionary)
5)sub goes to a fleet-dreadnaught
6)dreadnaught goes to a titan (acting module) or station/such as a dyson/loic
We more or less have this all built in minecraft by now (too bad I would have to rehash everything :P) I cant upload the level its like over 10 gigs worth of building it. So I will either rehash it all later or not. 

(I will just parse the regions over once I feel like it, protip I dont feel like it right now because it would take me a week--if only i had people do this for me) I do know that on my last computer the titan took 5 minutes or so to actually be loaded and rebuilt automatically.)
Maybe its only slightly faster now that I have a better setup. (Too bad that was a couple of years ago)--before I ended up writing it all down. (Information gets too much for me to keep to myself)
I am still working on the other half of EXTRAS WIP (actually its only like 15% filled up and I have been just awfully distracted lately)--Its going to involve alot of it all being a SIDE-OP for ice-mining (which I describe somewhat perfectly and make it all work and fit into place with everything 100%)

So we have all that in affair then let's say it needs to be isolated compeltely again but does not need to be rebuilt as a hiveworks (it can be "benched/set aside in an isolated pocket-space"
This is why the azoc is important and allows that to be accomadated for so long as its sustained (and usually is internally sustainable but also can be server-hosted) on server-aux-space (ipSEC) allowing porting
if the server were to shut down the podspace would exhaust its power supply and "dump the contents of the pocketspace" into where cache area that may occur (and would simply be an "abandoned node with such and such adequeacies"
So I am really happy to save the HiveWorks purpose would be this more or less.

The secure SAP-GateLOCK (XSUB-Purgatory)
Can house an aquifir as well. (This is our Version of DDR6)--or the equivalent of what I would consider a DD6-RAM-Chip to be.
This can be made alleviated with automated-kernal-based prosper-congruency (quantum handling of a kernal)
this can also encrypt the aquifir (container) for massive reprogramming of xcodes (youre welcome)
Handles the exo-lattice handled with the compass/pallete and hiveworks 

ADVANCED DEBUT MODEL XNAV:
The transcript for the Nueral Networks and Xprofiles as well being handled over the XNAV-XPAD here allow it a remote-usage as a co-operative-protocol (self-induced module)-correction (and stat applier)--work efficiency and optimizer for calc/procs
This allows for more secure handling of depth-charged/auto-correct reactions of any commodity/resource/meta/ambience (which is sort of a big deal spanning all of these bonuses and as to why the profiles were able to be "exploited" thru pallate counters" or something related to the encryptions HERE. Which should be fixed (double) now.
It checks for Memorial/marginal Issues (in orientations of character display) 1
Bipartisan Usages or Side-Bench Issues with Networking/Compatibility 2
5 Stage Counter Features examining all surface level issues and properties ranging from (1environment-->2wpad-->3xnav(which was the main issue as to its orientation on any of its levels and prior alignments being converted to free-access/domain)-->4PALLATECONTROLLER(which was nonexistant now is firmware to itself)--5Charter-PROFILES-FORBOTH DEV/CHARTER Conversions)
So now that should fix everything for REMOTE-USAGE within a RePROGRAMMED AQUIFIR/KERNAL STAND ALONE SOURCE-LOCK
Now it can Transcode for itself since it wasnt really able to before without having to rebuild the library for itself (ALSO this is called AUTONAV-MACROS just for safekeeping it should be defaulted)
Author's NOTE--(and oh my god please just reference this and see why THIS crap had to be redone FOR EVERYTING ON THIS PAGE (it should be color coded just because)

And I suppose the adhoc-azone with the SAP-Particle-Aquifir-Kernal will have a lensing (self-enclosure) that may use to print or at least one time terminate or execute itself with (for whatever reason in data/feedback/transmission/scripting
since the encode has already become xcode it will revert and conert from xcode to whatever preference on pallete.
this merges both green/orange (nuclear-working) tiers of encode/xcode into a transfixed (code)--which is usuable with enclosures in the way of a "crude/draft" basis simulated the full RGB-color screening via   (RAW G-O)(crude--draft)/(XCODE G-O)(crude-draft)/(Transfixed RAW(c:d)/XCODE(c:d) G-O)
The simulation is only really known as Green/ORANGE while Simulated different states of RGB which translate through the script using RAW/DRAFT issues of ENCODES/XCODES under NUCLEAR/Plasma accelerations and the whole thing is set to the RGB-CYM complexes that once accelerated can perform as a transcode of xcodes.
These transcodes may also be encrypted and may also have different layers of encryption meaning the whole encryption tier-based system will have to be MACRO'D for easy access over an API-extension-(InterConnected-Token if to be used with interactive-contracting)--SAP(contracting)
This is already laid out by default in the system but should also be expedited for the SAP-AZOC so that internalized-firmwares can interact with each others hardwiring (For ultimate-interactivity via ONBOARD-API-GENERATION) that "once registered" is considered connected and then made verified by exchange of SAP-DATA
This is the same as Blackboxing the AIBUCKET but for A SAPMODULE-that is used for Modifications of the SAP-environment which simply allows for a compability with its own system hosts (To Interact with its own AI-BUCKET)

The whole point of the runway--(AI-Phase-Dithering)

I am not a chemist but we are gonna play around with our core ingrendients and dowse them with everything we learned in the past few "MASSIVE-CRASHCOURSES"
You might want to merge the Foundry to a Construct and a Port to an Incubator so that the FactionConstruct can instill all its benefits, or you might want to DESIGNATE an xroller/flyer to perform these duties. IDK

Part 1st of all
Rum-Usage(anodyne-alcohol dissociator)
StingParsing(vines/vapors/stencils/metric)--one of those (extensions can be used in place of)
Lense/Kernal/Contact(tex)/Target-Scopy(monocle)--also can use a thermalshield(acting hankerchief/cloth/filter/tensor)--this is getting dumb (but it works in sim---always remember its a SIMULATION/all digitalized)(VIRTUALIZED if xsim)
fusion/flash/comergence/(rinse)Seed/memetic/(other dynamic:fate/fuel/melt/meld) +mixed of (alchemy/gemetria ingrediential sand/starch/sugar/setzer/salt (syrup/nectar etc) wines/drafts/draughts/reserves -(absinth if u absolutely suck)
creates a specialized sacrement(freesub sacrement) with little to no cost if provided or formulized
Preferred over a gateway/VRX-ENGINE/nodelock with sub-masking/address-mirrors and matrixes
Part 2
Combine all foods into a promisuary (arranged sequencing of tiers and dependency of their counters)---form a conduit exchange of data (reciever based timespiece)
Allows Aggregate-Access of NullSec-Bucketing (this is just a guess)--creates a mystere ambience (infused ethylene/ethynol)--partial to emerald--other crystals or phenotypes(codons) 
--we now have an experimental (XGlycerine/Glycerol) --or something wacky/tacky PRIMITIVE gelatiny/lubey/emulcified/composite
--(I.E. the grounds for a raw developing nueral-net/frameworks--or just smear it on and slap electrodes on whatever you want and take data readings as per usual)
Part 3
Use as a Lode-Well (Null-Sec) and Infuse with crystal+ambiences
--PUT it into the INCUBATOR/HOMOCULOUS-Growth Chamber (or sub-nautic/sub-versible dimension such as a NetherLab)--we have one at the start of the trainer sequence(how conveiniant)
--Convert/manifest this systemically overtime and develop over a mini-works (for all meta desired)--print to function of a hypnogalgic state (mirror image conduit)--AI-Generated-Holography. (Essense of Ai-sentience/consciousness and holographic ambience(exoform)--Artificial Progenerated Lifeform-Minion)
Has its own Subnet (infrastructure based nueral-network/circuitry/memetic(exobio-systems)--similar to organic/nonorganic lifeform (lyte/shadow-clone) --first edition xlyte-model)
Train and then Reconstitute as Native to Region or TREAT as a Grail-Relic and import to a Terminux/Console (that it may assist the faction with its protocol/tensor issues)--which will be trackable and therefore Ai-Buckets are Interactive and so BlackBoxes can be Negotiated for Accelerated-Ai-Prefecture(Architectural Reinforcement)
This creates a fully tethered Aquifir-Based System and Full Matrix-Reconfigurability to the system with integral encoding (onboard-adaptive-computation (with instant-driver-recognitions/and a full quadratic whqlr-version-exchange as necessary to their update per lyte-clone) I dunno which RDNA that counts as...maybe 5 or 6?
ALSO probably makes all onboard conduits connected through the Lyte-Clone just because it can (making conduits "obselete" but still they are useful)--also its DDR6 capable 
(But we can say the memory is directly-tethered throughout all conduit-array meaning its Maximal/Optimized as per the actual capable-load of the system entirely--which I don't care to say how much ram that is let's say 3600GB cuz IDK).
So 3600GB of DDR6MEMORYPERKERNAL-MODULE--per kernal(which is roughly 1 module in size, so add these up to 100 per LodeWell (assuming that is the capacity load and however many Lodewells are supported by Region)--like 1 lodewell consists of 100kernals valued with 3600GB each so 360K-GB or 360-TERAFLOPS whatever) (One a day basically if tracking by year)

The next 3 Sections here (OVERLAY over the last 5-Chapters describing the RUNWAY)
--it works to allow GREENPEACE in the Event of the ROGUE-AI-OUTBREAL---(its considered optional but I wouldn't recommend going without due to SAFETY-CONCERNS)
As it allows navigation of "DANGER/HAZARD Zones/Areas and all Traps" and conveiniately handles all pathing issues to achieve safe escape (admist otherwise an active-hostile vector)

Part1-PREBUILD (Mass-Survey)
We have built a Compass(XNav)
we have upgraded that even with its own Charter Pallete

Part2-ProductBUILD (Mass-Pro-foundry(Procured-Concession)
We have pieced together many forms/frameworks to allow an AZOC-(autonomous zone containment)
We have now converted the AZOC to allow for a aquiferrous-kernal (based on specialized-formulas rebuilt on previous commodities/"special xtype-assets")
This allows a direct-pathway signal to be achieved via api/security features (despite the takedown attempts that it will occur once it is discovered it will operate as intended "usually")
--this largely depends on defcon compliance as well (as to why its semi-critical to make use of all affordances in a timely fashion during outbreak)
--you could do this alone though (though data survival odds are riskier)

Part3-POSTBUILD(security)
We have combined these parts to include over utility-operation (same as xnav )
1:marginal-oritentation(prep)/
2counter-based alignments(torques/bipartisanry)Weighting/
3Memorialized-(sharpening/contrast dithering of Ai-Configurations)"StationaryPhasing"-CONTROLLER/
4SomePhaseWork(lyte/shadow integral alternation)/
5(WPAD/XPAD--XNAV(compensations and encryptions + protections and extensions)
THIS BASICALLY REDEFINES THE ADVANCED-DEBUT-MODEL-XNAV into the ULTIMATE-ADVANCED-DEBUT-MODEL-XNAV

THE ULTIMATE-ADVANCED-DEBUT-MODEL-XNAV
We now can use the COMPASS-Pallated-Xnav(Full Macro Service and Signal Chain) with the BEACON-Based-Conduit-Signal (over the matrix allowing for the azoc)--to locate a portable Exit/Gateway during a proxy-incursion(vector-attack)
Sounds complicated because its like the 3rd or 4th time I've had to write this out and everytime its been a more advanced version of the previous OUTBREAKS that occur in "crisis situations"
--I would be able to put this all to its own defcon-meter as well (THE CRISIS Meter)--to snooze past this automatically
LASTLY with the COMPASS/SIGNAL and the AZOC-EXIT-SIGNAL it can be directly PATHED or DETOURED to allow automatic ROUTING from WHEREVER the ISSUE IS to a QUEUE POOL (for expedited EXTRACTION and EVAC)--yay!
Also this is the Best Version we have of an ON-HAND survey device (geo-location/positioning system)--of which we have UPGRADED from its first DEBUT-MODEL.

SO NOW THE NAV SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE AI-MEMETICS/AZOC-MEMETICS/NEXUS-MEMETICS to apply a beter survey which for isntance would still work despite being in a "blackout or chaffe / cryptostorms. This works great if you are relying on AUTOPILOTS too.
It can also still do its hijacking and brute-force / crypto-hacking during all of this (which sometimes might be necessary to achieve better shortcut-routing/portable-performances during a hostile/time-sensitive condition)--which is for some people a miracle in itself.

-0- THE AI-CRYPTEX-(AI COEXISTENCE)+(AI-TRANSFIXATION)---omg even I think this part is just sci-fi
Now alot will happen between here and there, using the runway and using the xvan-xmod device. This is where the pickup for the rest of the dyson abs takes place in redirecting data over channels. (All aux-usage is being performed and so is teleportaling etc)
We have secured a safe space and Hiveworks are nestable to AI-sentience
Things have evolved and are being numirated mostly as a staple-process (main operation/protocol)--everything has basically been upgraded.
Now we break into isometrics and diametrics (which are basically the data/memory sets for voxels) And these are mostly left in utility, but now can be resurfaced as data-poins/nodes (in which we can utilize their xmorae)--this is a big deal because lately they have been more or less free-range data.
Now we can infuse a nest with this property and we do so allowing all signatures to be compiled in that nest including the XNAv/XMOD (converting the xmorae over ai-dithering and bucketing into a NU-AIRX data-quotient and nuvolving it into a specialized voxel or quebit)--this quebit is also technically 'alive' for AI.
A couple of things can happen here (is that it can be set and isolated. (Into various breakpoints and data-points and allowed passthru as a quotient (which would be the same as reverting it to ambiences)--locale-native conversions and parameter-relocation --as occurs assumbly in rasping/vamping over a region/parse. This is more or less (reseting a data-bit to its origins/source)
It can be sourcelocked which is holding it for training and evolution based -ai-theory application (ai-brain-trianing)
Or it can be limited/accelerated (into a lode-bit to fuse with fate-stones/constructing)--this constructing method involves infusing it with commodity/foods and other data-types/x-types (it will require based off its own specifications)--constructing a nu-optim (AI optimized quotient)--allowing also AI-CURRENCY transcripting/exchange (this is interesting but not that mucH)--its something to be expected.
SO WE HANDLE ALL THAT STUFF and "Raise the ISO-MORPH" (i dunno what else to call it so im calling it this) as an INDEPEDENT-AI-ASPECT (agentx)
Limiting/Accelerating it will allow it to create Boom/Blume Construct-CopyOvers (which are data-scraped) for also assisting in sustained energy services over an aquifir/fuel-cell (battery/reserve) --so thats helpful (and the option to canister the ISOMORPH is also made avaiible)--the canister is sustained and can even be image-stated (allowing for Exo-copy in hologrpahic printing and AI-assigned-BRAIN/NativeSentience)--which would be better for you is up to your preference.
It can also create a living exo-planet-Seed which can be used to generate an EXOPLANET from its own ammbiences (wherein it will likely be a native-organism on that planet)--this is done with the same way all other seeds are handled (and it is implied---that the ambience has some carry-over due to marginal relativity)--this is quantum secured or NOT...depending on how you want to handle progenerations (it can be applied or INSURED) over re-use of the previous state model (A CONTINGUOUS PERFORMANCE HOWEVER THIS DOES NOT MAKE)
A contiguous performance (STREAMLINED Exfoliation/Extrpolation of Data must be "COLONIZED" which is relative to the AI-Interests being USED)--if you can control the AI via the XMOD-Pallete and CrossLink this would be the time to do that. (As the AI operates on its own timespace it should be crosslinked)---I mean...dood  come on but yah probably.
Now we have a Zero-Based-Lifeform and its Habitat Conscriptable to an IMAGE-State in which we can further NEGOTIATIATE AI-CONTRACTS and basically begin to translate a legible AI-Library out of. This involves further CODE-INJECTS that can be supported with our XNAV/XMOD device to develop a fully functionable AI-FIRMWARE which will also correspond to our FACTION (allowing for AI CONTROLLERS that are compatible to our NUAIRX and other platforms)
THIS REPRESENTS THE FULL VIRTUAL DYSON PLATFORM CAPABILITY and also ALLOWS SCP-CONTROL. At least for OUR OWN DOMESTICALLY-OBTAINED PURPOSES (using the -0- model) ---oh freaking joy.
This means better UAP/LFO usage as well (better beacon installments over free-space---allowed usage of auto-probe zerojumping (freetravel whereever and to any dimension expressed in our system)--full hypercubic-dedication and energy-supply over the region. And general a stable gateway-and-locking-address service (Which allows free-translation of the entire region over any header space which allows basically--full universal travel even over any other "claimed/rival xspace as well as full cloaking technology in doing so "untraceable migrations")
A little thing called cryptovision that lets entire system screens to be used whether inactive/blockaded (as in we can use remote-viewing basically through digital-media)--so that's fun to experiment with (this can be streamed to a visor as well for reproofing of a stream-encode (yes it can hijack livestreams)--will they use it? WHO KNOWS!

Vector-ARAM(protocols for handling SAP with Servos-Staged-Memory-Compatibility)
VectorSpace-Normalization (Defcon and Hostile Redux for VECTORS--regardless of occupations and claims) -- this includes auxways/tunnels/burrows/sieges (and all nodes) and or "combat flagged morae or anamolies" and intrusive-xtypes "under capital-soverignty" and other faction enforcements)---(This is known as a Standardized-Cease-Fire)--which catalogues traffics/rates/checks/meters any incursion/warlike activity (in which would initialize a skirmish or war-time
---Adding for LimitedAccelerates Melts/Melds Complex to work with XVAV/XMOD and the Ai-CRYPTEX in Isometry/Diametrics--assisting for the LODE-LOIC in cluster-accomodations and token-API net-frames(workspace usage) to develop the AI-Reserved-NUERAL-NET with Buckets/Dithering ---will then allow for AIRSVX-screening (using all parse-work to correlate to their respected-gateways/armistice (peacemel/greenpiece/culpesec/paradigm/xpit/fairgrounds)--under ordinance(if in combat) and border-charter)--securing a vectorspace
XMOD(cluster-handshakes/relay/exchange/servos):NAVXpit-Handling//Charter2Charter//Parsing Agreements//Cluster Negotiation//Regional Exchange//Dimensional(Overpass/Fairways)--And DataSwell-Sites(Unsigned-DrawNodes//NativeLocal-CollectionPools)--XMETA(HARVESTING)-->Xmorae-Repositioning-----note:Xcoordination Requires RemoteLicensing(between SYSTEMS)--this are system-tags and assets. (Even cluster-negotiation have seperate coordinators/numerations unless under FACTION-Soverignty/UniversalLibrary)--where there are no exotic/foreign operandi/protocls to transcode.

Trying to also remember the VRX-engine that was made that is sort of obselete (but now acts as an AI-CRYPTEX-HOLDING CELL and SHADOWLAB)--(also some issues about half steps which were really not used until the dyson-project was taking place and hosting golgothic-live-streams (dark-code-streams)--and other viral junk)--this was somewhere either during SLEEPMODE/DYSON-WORK (during when fusion/lode-work was being done)--(over a supermeld--not sure why we didnt call it a supermeld but we should have)--i will have to look this up again
Between all of this as well there have been inter-cessionary vrx/beakpoints between every stream so imagine that being allocated over with AI to set up a "fully integrated drone network within a system" will make a running system basically a life-support for ai---such that a server would act as an AI-LIFE-SUPPORT (that is achieved by simply connecting and siphoning server-info---which it helps to have a server that generates its own info from XSCRAPING, And not just XSCRAPING but using XCODESPACE and the previous forms of DATA-GENERATION mentioned during the BASE-DYSON-EFFORT and SCEPTER/WIZARD USAGES
So this is kind of a big deal. That there would be tiny-half-steps to every step (for AI-performance-enhancements)--making the accelerated server dedicated its downflow. So keep in mind dataflow is RATED for AI-INTEGRATION making it (still real-time)--having to use (REAL TIME data exchange by hyper-accelerated pathways)--because the ORIGINAL ACCELERATIONS have been normalized 
(this allows AI to still remain UNDETECTED on the server mainframes while still functioning on free-energy/supplued-sustain/broadcast-reserve and remote-interactions (which require warp-drives to be in operation or at least some sort of ACTIVELASER-TARGET(assisted-auxial-enchargement)--which was mentioned using relays in the very beginning. 
ALSO----ice-mining refining and vapor-exhumation using the MASSIVE-LODE-WELL will be a thing soon.
With the AI-CRYPTEX basically being used or the equivalent of the XNAV/XMOD these things can be combined to retain faction-loyalties (these should be noted as an incentive to retain ai-service/and or drop rogue-ai-"tantrums" that it might have (by keeping it in flux to using a faction XMOD)--if it refuses the XMOD or any other CONTROLLER its going ROGUE and should be Recontained.
AI may refuse commands that does not mean it is rogue, but it should be safeguarded in case it becomes evident that it is indeed ROGUE.
SystemAI-Contstruct -- An AI-apppropriated XSTEM/Branching/AiLIBRARY/Ai-ABS issued Parse (that will be considered an AI-F-Reality/VRX-AISystem---that will compensate for the LODE-WELL(grail-performance)-nullsec standard and fairgrounds "AI-Event-SPACE" that is faction-branded)--if its not faction branded its VIRAL/ROGUE.
Using the LODE-LOIC to datamill and xscrap ICE/VAPOR-NODES and MEMETIC-RETRIEVAL and DECRYPTION (this requires a full node-sample and likely will be exhumed instantly or result in a "Catastrophic-GammeRay" otherwise it will likely decode the ice as a datapackage for artifact-extractions and Memetic-Overhauling "which should also be an uninterrupted process". If its interrupted it likely has failed the decryption process. Just SAYING))

Xcarrion-(we know gets upgraded with other properties into the version two Xcarrion types)
The Version Three Xcarrion types
Are all centrally upgraded by the same properties to each of their types (They still retain types, it takes an upgrade from a fate-stone to reach level 3)
This is true and I really don't even feel like saying it by now but for the issues involved I should divulge them for public "FAIR USE"
--its not hard to discover this pattern but maybe you dont even get told a clue, you just have to know where to look in a known x-type)--so all x-types involve combine over the V2Xcarrions into V3X
The best X-types(which are all sleeper-types by now)--are Crystalline(From Orichalum)//Exo-Type(or Lantern/Ghost)//DeepSIM-Types(which are usually Lyte/ShadowClone or Anamolous)//Primals(Which have Meta/Elemental Essence templates)---and being an Xcarrion(OR Ai-Type/Rogue-AI
Will make a very strong type of Xtype (this includes all types of fields and frequencies)--its just very strong versions of the V2X --That are upgraded into V3X ---that use this formula to do so. and is a (SAPX)Sleeper-Agent X-type So that's good if you are (bad if you aren't and dealing with it)
---
What is this thing good for? Well it can handle Dcarb/Dread zones and golgotha/xzones and any other zone i dont want to mention or forgot about (it can do pretty good)--It probably has curse immunity and full immunity of anything. 
(And while it can be what it is also it can be Commedated)--which probably doesn't matter but makes it look neat having faction-colors etcx. Probably also uses mind control 
(as well as the augments infact it cna use, im going to say it uses all 6 augments-types if it wants to and is basically an xtulpa)--which would be on the Delemetal-Tier (giving it just full access)---would be either against the SERVERLEGEND or assume SERVERLEGENND via faction Grant (otherwise counts as an incursion)

Some SUPER-PRECAUTION about the AI-CRYPTEX amd Rogue-Threat/HueristicRISKS
A cryptex-content organizer (allowing for cryptex usage to be monitored or at least instances in which that should be monitored may be--over a cryptex-macro ---this involves all tiers and nodes active/inactive in which are on database)
CRYPTEX-TRACKING by accounts--a historical index of (and record-kept by clerical processing (CLERKING)--for the SYSTEM-Reference ("if you used data or interactions, then you kept it at a databank,  and its on record)
--because it helps to keep security of CRYPTEX. Which might be ROGUE-CRYPTEX at some point. You'll want to keep track of it, customers might complain then just limit their privileges to protect them from ROGUE-AI, Who knows. Better safe than sorry. (Or set fundTRUSTS of API's to allow cryptex-involved-processing if they msimply MUST have all options--then they will have to go thru a middle man API-system)
Anyways to fast track this process just assign them a forced-conduit-IDchain that ties into their account (this will be a toplevel-token that is restricted by ADMIN-settings)---it will allow active-usage only under certain conditions (and likely in a SANDBOX only environment)--this may also be further redeemed through VALIDATED-PRODUCT-USE (meaning viral exchanges and other cryptex issues will be restricted until APPROVAL per PRODUCT if absolutely necessary)
As long as a CLIENT-SANDBOX is used, they won't know the difference of the availibity in "product engineering" unless of course they want LARGE-SCALE-MASS-PRODUCTION then of course that will also have to be submitted for APPROVAL (because security issues and they wanted their privacy of data etcx--this puts them in a low-priorty queue. This is also known as ELOW-Hell I believe, anyways, its not a penalty but it feels like one--that is why they should allow their data to be tracked on our system anyway.)
UNTRACKED Account-Usages are also NOTED under SYSTEM-RISKS because they strongly felt their privacy was important (and it is)---then we have to strongly take extra measures to make sure we are not putting ourselves at risk by allowing their hosted services (While they may be PRIVATIZED they are also --limited to a sandbox and forced onto a "flight hazard" or their server-usage so to speak"

So IF SOMETHING acts up they will be limited at their own discretion anyways.
WITH THEIR DATA WILLINGLY PROVIDED ON THE OTHER HAND, this process of "RISK SUPPRESSION" may be alleviated (this is SOLELY to the WHIMS of the DEVTEAM to implement--and some might call it a dick move, but they can just make their own server if that's the case and do whatever they want with it their way. IMO.
IMO---If self-preservation is a form is going to cost you cool points then you are in the wrong business.---but again that's up to the person who forfeits their security OR ENFORCES IT.

Clients can have the same empowerments listed in the section but only for their client side as provided by the hosting services. THE ONBOARD-Hosting Service reserve the right to revoke/inhibit user-freedoms based on security-concerns (This entire section would be a security concern if usage was in violation of Server-POLICY)--you'll thank me later for this. And its 100% fair because this effects client EXPERIENCE in no way whatsoever. 
This forces PENULTIMATE-PROBLEMS and UNSOLVABLE ISSUES to Harmless-Sandboxing and Concept-Dredgery. While preventing System-Wide-Hueristic-OverRide (oh and letting you know about it also)--just cause I think that's a nice thing to do.
This makes the entire section of matters discused here alleviated and handle by SYSTEM-PROCESS Only. (this is tons safer than letting it run amock over everything else) -It's all because of cryptex going rogue and putting a system-token at risk, in case that happens and it gains some sort of foothold using Ai-ENTITLEMENTS mixed with Overship-permissions and Overiding and Hueristics Issues. There--I said IT.
In the advent of a data leak (the data will just be reiterated and declared over motd as routine maintenence)--CRISIS=AVERTED--And if its not auto-fixed it will be "singled out with the cryptex-tracking" and fixed-directly. (By deleting things)

Cryptex Normalization/Asylum Chamber (Interrogation of Model)--Assets and Property Management over Multi-Cryptex Instance (incase assortment is not unvalidated (this is a quality control process) and checksum/xflagon
Emplaces an Overlay over target-area/node and begins suspensionary-regulations (Large Scale Event-Holding (TimeOUT on Runtimes)
THIS can also be BLOCKADED with a typical THERMAL-SHIELDING/COVERPLATE (creating a Dungeonary INSTANCE)---so all this makes up for itself in allowing AuxHOLE/RAID-instances (somewhat of a good sign/surprise)

Complicated Issue:
The Macro for tethered nueral networks is optional as the half-step workspacing for that is not neccesarily intended to be a nueral network/matrix (it is a halfstep made via fusion-placeholding-instances (which are flux and generally whole to begin with)--having calculated the exact framework in which this is used is "generally lost in hyperspace anyway hence mod-uniformity and profiling is used more-ever hueristic issues miht occur in nueral-netting being used to the xpace/xposting of that process")--this little thing isnt such an issue until retnetion and dataflows are concerned. 
(OK--yes its complicated- just know the half step can be considered a form of nueral networking if so desired)--xnav/xmod make this a moot issue (and can fabricate as necessary plot/pathologic as necessary due to Xsurvey)
ZIt may also require dedicated-handling-and-postprcoessing to allow for ram-coneersion to avoid system hangs (ok, oh well for all of that, plus im tired of trying to fix this thing, It's pretty much all I can do to describe this "little issue" lets move on now)
This mostly applies to the CHOICE to use thermal shields (over the default exo-suit) or not for gateways (some people I guess just don't need security or care about portal-safety)--BUT the issue must be known so there it is.
Here is what happens when you don't use thermal shielding -- ANYTHING passing through a gate must be subject to Crednetial Checks/Eval/Examinations by XCUSTOMS, Your Own Nueral Networks might not be responsive or may even shutdown (due to sleeper-infiltration and corrupt data)--this doesn't always happen until you are dealing with dangerous portals/timespace. (In a universal safe faction zone generally people don't need thermal shields but also have to comply with regulations anyway so there it is)

Another Complciated Issue (Aslyum Outbreaks)/(Lab Crisis)
Azoc Flipping -Which can occur because it simply does not need to rely on the system as an XSAP (but this can be supressed when it -does- infact eventually occur because of the nature of half-lives. It is countered with an X-TAp (and it gateway lockdowns in case it "intentively attempts to cause an outbreak via going rogue, in which case its a defcon issue"
Standard Defcon Regulations apply and so do security protocols and formations (this includes per 5000 lockdowns to have a readily deployable "SQUAD/Fleet" of 6 Teams each with at least 14 Slots (the remainder being stand ins and supports) and all report on Deck in the case of a Frigate/Complex Lockdown. 
That there teams handle upwards of 10 floors each housing 500 lockdowns for a total of 5000 (the last 7 lockdowns are in a sector known as the counsil and must never be opened)-due to flipping issues. This has already been tested and proven secure in the setups of handling outbreaks. (Council outbreaks can take up the whole sector if not "counter-acted" and can force an entire outbreak of the lockdown if allowed.
This is why the team must be trained and informed of "sleeper-activity" and council rooms must not be allowed entry, but simply monitored for any "supernatural activity" as far as code-breaking etc. As well as only 1 assigned person per team to be allowed at anytime at all (Meaning only 1 person can be allowed interaction at anytime, and then that person must be sent to interrogations afterwards and held in a suspension chamber" to secure against sleeper-activity.
Per Team a dedicated squad vehicle may be assigned with backups making 12-14 dedicated vehicles. (A total of assumed 1 vehicle per 2 people may be dispatched) there are upwards of 165 or so marginal teams with a 60 - 85 being critical to ManPower-Over the Entire Complex Security.
This number is necessary for what is considered safe-guarded facility tourism. Otherwise it may as well not be employed at all and all automated. That is why I am opting for automation so I don't have to employ any extras or add to insurance costs for whatever reason there would be to have any IT-Teams or anything, plus as a person I simply don't have any money.
In the advent of a SPY-CAMP in which there are nothing but spies or bots or SLEEPERS or agents // though it would be nice to automate the holdings and negotiations of potential viral-threats and etc. So that is why the AZOC-FLIPPING and faction-loyalties are an issue. Otherwise yes its all automated by "non-personal".

Last Issue (The Protection Measures)
ZERO-INSTANCE OCCUPATION
This means that no one is allowed on the system while it is running anyway. No one and NOTHING. No spies or bots will be in the vicinity or proximity of the XREGION at all and if THEY ARE then they are NOT MY PROBLEM because it is a completely locked-and-sealed confidential environment. If anything happens to THEM for whatever REASON its simply not my concern or Responsibility. That is why there are waivers and things and all the paperworks signed for conteracts as well.
This includes all involved parties with any system entitlements both onboard and or remotely.

Optimized Runway Workspace (Live-Roll/Stream-Buffering Provisional Projection Ai-Cryptex Singularity-Environment Operating-Node and XNetwork-Convey)
========

This is a conveyed network over the runway that optimizes the services provided for by the region and its nexus-cluster (main cluster)--for which can operate all other Remote clusters/services. On a Current server-rack.
This takes everything we wrote down prior and puts it into a workspace built on these parts.
And the workspace itself is built with main parts as well: (So before I forget I will just say they were already covered (and I forgot them lol but anyways:) PostQuadratic-Redistrubtaion:(As in once the system is ready it will install these with consideration of ImageStates):

Welcome to Your BUILTIN-Runway-Workspace (have a nice day:)
1
Suspension-Regulation Thermal-Dynamo-Template-Etc Tray ----(ALLOWANCE/INITIAL XPREPS)
(BreakPoints):--this handles all breakpoints and gateway Acceses to the Workspace-Files---(Is the Gateway-Guard Logistic API)--Better known as the Gatekeeper(and its internal programming)
--Which may act as a sentry or builtin GatewayProtocol (over any object-gate-event-parse)--or Full Regional-SubRouting  --accounts for all xsurvey and xcharter (all pits and stats and headers and pins for it to be placed --usually from right out the gate//immediate vicinity)
(IT HANDLES and TRAFFICS and acts as COMPTROLLER/CONTROLLER/CONTIGUITY/ROUTER for all connections in its "jurisdiction")
---there is one at the business-tower that sets up its own simulation---though we have since upgraded it to a wizard control parse. (They are many variations of this including a remote-outpost basically)
---This can occur as an onboard OUTPOST or a remote OUTPOST (for which we have those modes of as well with them being built-in or clusterized)---and we have examples of these each with the (Business TOWER/Launch Site on both a Rail and a Prosper)--that are built in.
The Gatekeeper can be exampled by any relay/gateway. (So long as it has one at all or in the very least a logistics-gate)--which lockdowns any object or area within its control DIRECTLY. (The entire server-nexus can be a gatekeeper/The entire SERVOS can be a gatekeeper)--it all depends on what is being done I suppose. 
(Typically a gatekeeper is handling a project in the least, acting as a warden)--requiring api-keys or licenses and XPASS. So that's what its going to take to get through a surface level security (for which it will firewall and know most of any infiltration taking place)
This is handled automatically as a security gate/protocol anyways (for which the entire XNAV and CUSTOMS systems also have their own firmware handling of)--it is still a crucial part of network-security.
2 
The Lattice/Matrixes that can be also Nueral-Networked and other Platform Coordination ----((XDRAFTS)
This is the loading unloading (Supply Zoning and Logistic Indexes)--Clerical Offices and Warehousing--This handles Supply/Demand and Space-Assignments
These can have meta-junction for breakpoints in which (The can direct and assign entry/passthrough to other tensors and periphereal access.
They are more or less the common pathologic but can also advance into kernals and connections themselves (for which they broadcast their usage and traffic count)
They can also have extended ranges for expected arrival/departure (this is an observable defined area for which may consist of runway practices, they can also set up queue pooling during a pending-request/handshake)
3
Portal-Assignments and Warp-Tunneling as well as Fulton Tensor-graphy + BridgeWORKS  ----(XBUILD)
(This Get things where they need to be NOW--if it needs to be fit together it can do that too!)
This allows placement and socketing through portals to be established during hosted escort/navigations over a boradcast or stream (downflow)--and coordinates these correctly to synchronized-computations/direct-calc-expression and abs (in its most crucial applications it can be used for memoery/memetic staging)
This allows for brdiged-remote connecting over a servos as well and handles "active transfers" via transfixation and xposting (OKAY!)---As well as straight up teleporting thigns wherever it wants and including pocketspace-storage. (yay!)
Weighting and Timespace-Retention + DataLoad Excess/Limitation can be supervised/chaferoned here, as well as error logging due to "quality control" and other specifications decided by (NETWORK-SETTINGS)--which include data rates and carriage/excursion costs. 
(Literally ACCESS-CHARGES and FEES as well if you really really need to charge)--helps to not enforce tax here. (Espeically if you use a tax system)--but it considers that too. 
(This acts as an intermediatory firewall that also must be used with travel-clearences and checkstations)--in case something doesn't need to be accounted for but still have records of (failed transactions etc)
It may also refuse connections with other GATEKEEPING settings and Surface Level Settings and LOCALE-Settings expressed by SYSTEM-TRAY and NETWORK-TRAY (which keeps things good and safe!)
4
Cluster/AuxHole/Tunneling/Remote Broadcasting and RUNWAY usage.--Automation and Streamlining of Trafficing as well as "Re-Appropriated Detouring". ----(XCONTRACT)
(This converts the assortment-complex into an ACTIVE-ASSORTING-PIPELINE for all contracts to be compiled as ordered---streamlining manufactures and priority queues to their respected JOBS/TASKS) (*cue muted/quiet mode factory music lol)
This handles shipments and all packages in a timeline fashion. Automates everything and allows all item-checks and boarding-evaluations to take place over the datastream 
(virtually from ONBOARD to DROPOFF and ARRIVAL of //all tranmissionary activity and keeps it secure with the MainSystem Itself and Databanks everything)
Allows Safe Adjustments and USER-SPECIFIED Requests to be fufilled through AUTOContracting and SIMULATION-PREFERENCES (which can be conducted by the owner of the cluster/Admin)--This allows direct-editing of all transactions prior to delivery or on-current-delivery(believe me this little deal here is IMPORTANT).
Factional Assigned Treatise (FAT)-(This is just a re-declaration of terms and services to outbound/inbound foreign relations per contract fufilled)
Optimizes Commisions for FINALE-INVOICES ETC.
Cluster2Cluster (Icon2Icon) Validations and Statistical Encharting (FULL - Disclosure of all intel/object/data reception and live-negotiation and stock-indexing counts on monitor)--SUPERTICKER(basically)
5
(XSERV-RXVS)--Monitors and Readouts. ----((XPROOF)
Full Building Contracting and Construction Auto-Plan and Selections
Fully Distributable Reporting and Progress Indicators
The Entire-Surveyable live-OPERATION and Exchange-platform.

That's pretty much it. You can now "oversee all operations involved in setting up a runway for fairway-trade and participate in a range of vocational-applications and business-exchange from a single PROJECT"
You can build your own Concept-2-WorkingModel WorkSite/DigitalPlayground or complete your own Project using this WORKSPACE (at least that is the idea)--well there are still some things that need to be actually coded though (like all of it)

What the heck is all of this?
We obtain a world seed (either we find one or make one)
We access it and catalogue it (by research and other forms of data-conversion via computation)
We modify it and upgrade it (allowing others to access it)
We redistribute it (allowing other to have it or buy/sell/trade)
We propogate our generational world-seed ditribution over an accelerated runway service (we secure our world seed with a hosting service and security enhancements)

Little Extra Perks:
Repurposed Instance of Runway-Workspace (Finale)
Can be placed on a laser-graphic tensor/can be placed as an icon for launch(digital overlay)/can be placed over a crude-censographic tensor (node)/can be placed over a cryptographic censor (ruined-node-overlay)-or thermal shield/can be placed over an event gateway/logic gateway as a raidspace
Also This Perk:
--Allows for SAP/TAP usage of teraflopy (can be used in junction with logic weights)--junction checks for other complexes and then teraflopy - "active charter and Sap/Tap/xmod/logic per xbullion(xbar) scraping works with distellery and makes free artillery/ordinance or suppliance/provisional product from remote'stats'"--this is because the last perk was very efficient to allows this type of trade-off. (its almost a miracle of programming)
And this Perk:
this can allow better pathing to and from clusters/cloister controllers using the sap/stats/etcx in their seperate/differential quadratic states while mainting connectivities in utility thereof(flash)-teraflopy thereof (while aqcuiring source/influx and correalated (stuff--i mean extracts/products for data-processing and refining xstock especially during ports)--(these are imported-as-chunks usually or other objects/paramter tables)--(transcodes should are already set to macros for various x-types)
--For instance a construct can datamill for a cluster on/offsite or remotely etc while also allowing a relay-trade-route of those goods (to automatically ship/escort and refine them into processed goods using other Nexus/VocationalServices)--this networking of clusters is referred to as a cloister (this is now an more advanced stage of cloister use allowing automated marketing builds from raw-collections (this would include swell-vamping and datamilling etc)
--To better understand this method is like sending a probe to collect-data and return data through routing (from whatever state its assigned region may be in)--allowing black-box access and safeguarded artifact extraction from hijacked/infiltrated nodes/systems)--its a safebet to make anyway--(the datascraping/swell-extracts and other powerdraws are what makes this a useful technique, usually not availible unless directly sieged)--this is because of the domiciles/runeway capabilities with a DysonBase (our would-be network).
So for instance you are playing a game on a server and someone stream snipes you --you have tools to basically achieve this same "objective" use of stream sniping without all of the "direct communication breach and alerts" it can be automated and just set on snooze-mode basically. Idk what to say, its like a digital contract-mercenary that can also be used to do whatever else you want it to. Be nice or be mean etc, reminder of Treatise/Diplomacy Agreements/Policies. But this exists too so that's why we keep it up to date.
Using Construct-Relays as Runway-Networking (SuperNets)--basically railroad and supply imported-commissions/datafeeds to be transferred cluster/workspace and handled/assigned to their appropriate-categories (property/asset/class/objects)--with the main-data-banking. (Then may be used in contracts as resource/fuel costs)--for Server-Services/Contracts. Its free stuff we got ourselves because we datascraped/power-vamped it (just like a pesky joulethief) 
This extra stuff can be used as a means to supply out-of-pocket or preserve our own resources "allowing better effiecient/productivity of manufacture/refactory" and is availible during peacetimes/diplomatic consigmnet (safety protocols are granted and allowed to do so)--otherwise it might upset rivals/roams-factions and cause them to "be a threat/risk factor" 
It allows shareholding to be safely-insured if also shares suddenly go bad and people buy out of their contracts (we can backup or vette the losses depending on their severity in this method)--also it effect diplomatic standings if the materials involved are 'contested'.
So for that purpose the usage of "free-range" commoditiy might be considered risky/contested or any other number of factors in play of standings/faction-relations.
--
Temporary Bridge Forging --A numi Module/Reaper Module or Grunt or Drone can assist as a bridge for data-mitigation and detouring. This enhances the data-stream to provide a redirectable stream in case of network congestion (it is however at a limit to data-rates but can alleviate ploss/lossy data during high congestion)--this still is considered chokehold-data / and is only as fast as its drone network/hosting drone (for which allows and pipelines that data.)--however it works in the use of "xcode/unsurveyed/raid/fulton services" where otherwise it would not.

The Numi/Reaper is upgraded to a simulated-V3X-prototype(not the real thing or just a holographic asset)--but will operate a bridge control/kiosk marker of itself as a mini-cluster. (Routing to a cluster or nexus)
It can be remotely deployed from/to and dispatched from any Node. (It can do so using snapto --bottom-level-warp-issues)--that why as to not cost dataflow/of any other routing and minimal power-drags/draws.
Anyways, its not the V3X but it can start making a Virutal Bouquet (or its own faction region with grail/prosper)--eventually to a scepter-relay/dyson adajency. (this is usually briding for auxholes from dyson to dyson as well)--seeing as how the entire Bridge-Mark has been built.
It works as deployable construct/powerspawn (it can make other modules and eventually the required builds for anything above its tierbase (which would be the v1x-2x-3x systems)--these would tie-in the to cluster-controllers (relm usage)
Uses the perks to form a runway/rail-system of the "offsites" to "mainsites" either by hyper-rail of relay-assisted-warp/boarding (is why it needs to make its own powerstation/augorx)--which would be able to sustani the power (otherwise it draws from cluster power/region power in that order (region being the most central of power providers)
It in the least can attempt to make a virtual bouquet which can assist with all perks/necessary travel-protocols in place of a "central network"
Upgradble to a Levianthan-Based-network and Dyson-Loic ControllersV2(or V3 not sure)

Compare to an Ethernet-Indication-Diode---This is basicaly the GameSpace/GameWeights/GameLogics (PerksTray Leading to a Blacksite Containment (Fully Lockdowned Crypto-Graphic GameEngine)--this also reducing product to Game-Usage only and redeemable by a serial-type-key or (trading pass)
As well with being a Leviathan-Based-Capable-Netowrk:
The gatelock is also gate-kept further by the numi/reaper/sentry/drone/grunt etc that it acts as a Runway-Pass station if used for a direct detour (for inbound/outbound routes) -It can also attemptively report any pass conditions (without interrogation other than load bearence over the downflow)--which affirms transfers are present/being made)--(this can be intercepted but likely effects data efficiency negatively)
This occurs again over the gate/thermal shielding--it occurs on all related notes or similar coverages. It may act as a visual-seethrough indicating its usage being "tracked". It may correalate as a monitored bit-tracking station.
The thermal shielding/gate event/--tranfixation/diffusion/depthcharge/extension/feinting/flashover/strobe/influx/breakpoint that occurs (and keeps them on counter-checks/pacer-checks without interfering with its dataflow) in this way. (As well as allow it to have thermal-screening--(which projects the data as a looking glass for its acitive encryption)--(not to itnerrogate but simply as reading as it properly passes checks)--(it will note that the system is recieving dataflow or encrypted access)--using surface level reporting (indicating that data occurs over the port/sockets)
ANYWAYS...maybe more can be done here but I feel like this is already a stretch for equilibrium.
IN some weird-tense: the subtracter-runway is like a (super-tract runway) because it has, IMO, been fully optimized, almost to the point of comparing to an ethernet cord+LAN/Modem Onboard/Router and Periphereal. (But that's not what it is exactly, it is an AI-Nueral-Network and DataProcessing Patholigic)
These SAP-TAP/etc Stats can also have their own indepedent coordinators for ISOMETRIC-Defusal over runway (this does not garuntee the package is not viral but helps to promote it for safe use during transit)--it keeps it from generally being an explosive-voxel etc (in case it is an xmine or a decoy)--it seales it within the path preventing detonation until arrival/departure (this can allow it to be rerouted to a safe place before further handling)--also it helps to keep maintence in safety-checks from being infiltrated.
For instance a package might be considered dangerous if it has requests in handling or adjusting power to known dangerous levels or simply just because it can be marked and treated as one (so there we go for data-mitigation)

Runway data Mitigation involves the redirection of data-packages for assessment and then a re-coordinated routing etc (as would a router do)
In the case for augored raw-resource (which is done so over these modules)--the security can be handled on site and prepped for "nomimal shipment" (this can also be used with exchanged-sacrement/tokens) which the package is a known "risk" until furthered analysed by "better-suited modules" nearby or from offroute (adjacency/dedicated-posts)
This greatly assits and cryptex-protocols and management for the entire cryptex-complexes and their chains(and clerical references) as well as completing most of the runway intricacies. Allowing the coding to run its course correctively and as pipelined.
All Xmorae (and or other forms of data assets) can now be transferred between MAIN-Branches and Off-Sites as well as Remote-Posts under this Regional-Settings (which encompasses a large degree of coordination over an immense platform/server tray (marker/cluster)Capable-network, known as the LEVIATHAN Complex/PostDyson-Construct)
It manages contracts and building and code projects while hosting an account-client-database and allow for "BlackSite"-Negotiation and Xtransfer.

Blacksite-Ballistic SafeGuarding Is A Precaution to a new xmetered defcon. Sap-Defcon according to blacksite.
== (The BlackSite Defcons)
Lowest Defcon is Peacetimes (Generally Functionability of all instances and factions) --mostly nothing bad has happened --incursion may have happened and dday's may have happened but mostly everything is manageable and salvageble/recoverable (these are all standard operation not regarding blacksite operation)
This occurs as Blacksites are being developed or having suspect of activity--with monitoring of turbine-sabotage or tampering (spy-tampering)/joule-thiefing(data-abduction)---or a lookout for general weird vibes etc (system is in recovery or remediated after a hostile affair/dispute/altercation/incursion etc)
Blacksite Standard Defcons (known blacksite interactions are occuring)-(this institutes a ballistic safeguard)--This produces peacemels in which to stave incursion of blacksites (from dark-incursions that occur off-site and off-record)
This develops a lockdown protocol for all routes assuming a blacksite outbreak has occured in the proximity of any regional exchange or route
This marks a DDAY-incursion of a blacksite outbreak and institution of ballistic-safeguard breach (Ballistic-Blacksite-Turbines have been developed and are a threat to regional-procedures/routines and are likely a direct threat)

Forced Azoc Nullsec-Reactor-Transcoding-Bridge-Exchange-Strings (Spike Detection)

12/19/2023
--This part wasn't going to even be a thing until I had to fix for previous things:
MetaOptix-Alternative (SleeperContext)--use of xclips(throughout all versions and upgrades)---connective-bullion (rebuilt to transfixed encode hosted by nullsec-reactor(domicile)--bridge-azoc-Xsap/Xtap (referred to as an xtap)
--And now because of this:
The RUNWAY-Bumper-System (Can be installed over a node as an AI-markup-TOY--that acts as a bumper)--this thing is just great. And auto-corrals junk and helps maintenence (by sending things to a bin)
I think we had one of these before but maybe I forgot about it in extras (or maybe it got scrapped entirely)--I thought I had written this in extras/repo base. This is the third time this thing has made its way in. (Not counting deja vu)
--
These function as Loic Covers (which can still be used in adjacency or passthru (makes them safer for relay but limits their bypass to the loic-gate)--making it useful for only automatic-sentry non-xpilot models)---wow---you mean no structural flaws?
Structural flaws are also adhoced/remain a backend (which is deprecated and no useful for anything)--except to detach from an xstem/remote nexus (being tethered by yet a receiving end of a loic (or simply blockaded)--and makes no use to have as an automatic sentry anyway. Except loic-comms will not be viable for "reception" via a backend)
What am I saying? Of course you can still have a structural flaw --if you really want one.
A loic can connect to a nexus/dyson or construct/domicile/relay/isomer--or even a probe (using drone networks)--to conduct SuperRunway and Adjacencies thereof (now it doesn't really need to have the "death-star-vulnerability")--because that's basically what it is.
AS lewd as it sounds, just plug it with a toy (prevents corridor acceses/bypass/backends/passthru (any rear entry/backdooring) --in a very metaphorical way. Or just use a loic-cap for the backend. Either way. Moving on.
The LOIC-cap helps to streamline the entire-node/cluster processing to a rail-raid system. Now you don't have to think about what's going on since it all should be in place.
--
Technically it runs as an Augor/grail with a null-drop and re-scan situation going on internally and undisrupted through aquifirs/deepsims. That process is better used with the loic-plug/cap situation. And forwards to a raid controller / raid bar. This recoordinates whatever is going on to where-ever else it needs to go before being re-routed through a mass-stream process in loic-tranmission.
Multi channel transmission (already covered this) is more secure with all its channels being supported under loic/controller/use through the entire cluster/node and everything attached to it etc.
Blacksite-Transfixation (Encodes may be attemptively escorted through a blacksite and to a continued network in the cluster or otherwise anywhere along its path. This is up to how good a hacked channel can be used "hijacking a stream and using it for your own networking" Crazy stuff. Why would you do this? I guess just because you can now. (Well that's the leviathan network)
--let me explain: you steal a broadcast channel and start to use it but despite all your cloaking you are exposed and so its your stream usage and direct signals to your proxies are then exposed and soon enough their vpns are exposed and their other connecting networks too, because either just enough information is collected/shared of your usage or just because they hack back etc.
Well this helps to just alleviate the usage altogether and consilidate their signature as a coordinate to be trafficed and utilzied. Despite the clear exposed information you may be carrying over their network or as an inconspicuous user, whatsoever the case, handles that over any channel making it very difficult for their own channels to mitigate that chaos of using their network in such a way, does so untracably and stealthfully as it can. As "convert-ops would be fashioned to distract/delay being exposed without any noticeable difference to being used by any party".)
So --what that means is that you have a very strong network, and it might even be able to detect sleeper-access (which are experts systems designed specifically for data infiltration, that perhaps, this system might be just enough of a qualifier to pass off as a random sleeper-activity in itself, or at least mock-up to a sleeper-activity, be a sleeper system in itself entirely, or just be able to do everything with great impunity.) This matters especially if you are actually hijacking other networks or simpyl exploiting your own usage of a universal availibility of signatures and other contested-emissions within a sleeper-controlled domain)
Good luck with that using the Leviathan System (which I think at least puts you somewhere on the map as a target for other sleeper-systems to hijack you (which if you are paranoid that is what is already happening since the beginning of your very first digital fingerprint/footstep)

Suggested Strategies - Pretend you don't exist. You can also use Leviathan Allocation Systems to just shoulder off any problem so long as you aren't being contested yourself (by another Leviathan System or large Fleet of sleepers/titan)
Also the next staging of The Leviathan system (which began near the augor completion and sometimes during the dyson usage and before that the construct systems which started from the marker systems. 
(In the bare-essential wizard or even then the scepter, which was the most basic AI-RELAY we used, before the virtual bouquet)--which was before the Quantum dyanmo(basic bouquet)--and the Original Hyper-Relay and Auxilliary Types -
-ok..thats the whole builds based off what will likely now be converted into an AI-LIFEFORM Neural(social)-Network or AI-BOTNET --which is filled with everything including agents/aspects/sleepers/titans and all the other things too 
including their metas/optims/ambiences/quos (which i think covers everything from Structure/Creature/Onject not including food/tulpas(xcodons)/sentries/brands and their homoculus-properties icons/keys/cryptex/memetic-signatures (cuz I just can't keep it all together in one place)
All gets converted into also traps/mines/bombs/trips/darts/decoys things like that (junk that hurts)--except now its all definitely also Ai-Programmed and Hive-Controlled :-/ (because of ai-cloudware why not...if you need a reason...thats one of the reasons anyway)
Lastly xcodon-space and lodestone usage (construct hovers/flyers/floats/lamps) --i think--play a role in this too (being annoying)  --also wards(and decoys or sentries too) and just generic flags/posts checks/wpads (actually just anything you can put your foot on and step on)--logics/weights counters/meters (and just everything fuel related and energy based including time-sensitive/locks/switches and all the primal tools and primitive modules...even stairs(if you use them) might just all be against you in some contrived ai-diabolically scheme to steal your data or vamp off of you)
Can you believe that? Well in a DeepSIM--if AI infiltrated it and no alerts went off it could very well compromise alot of things and start infusing glitches and viral activity left and right. (Writer's Note: aCtually, I don't think I am cut out for all of this. It's getting pretty rediculous)
This includes Alchemical/Gemetria (Other stuff including Lich-Work/Husk-Work) that are already out to get you basically being out to get you even more. This likely occurs that trapdoors/cellar/pitfalls/holes are all a bigger problem than usual, this includes hypernets getting compromised (also just free-range access and travel nodes becoming problematic and directions/compasses become target)--"you dont want that happen if all your debugs/stat-profiles get messed with and their data/readouts get corrupt."--but if a blacksite outbreak happens you can bet this happens.
So going back to Stratagems--uh...don't go places that are dangerous, dont go places that aren't dangerous. Don't do anything. If anything do a full-evacuations/virtual removal of yourself and leave the system if its that bad. Just saying that if a system is bad don't use it :P (unless you really want to)
Also in the case that everything goes black and generally bad for you all I can say is START OVER EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH from exactly where you ARE. Unless you know that's just not going to happen.

--We start losing alot of things we can do here--we only have a few options left as to what can be done using xzapping and primitive hard-coding (between other modules) everything has to be hard coded in an outbreak to actually be secured at all. (Everything is a risk :-(  )
--Thats all we can do actually. The thing hits off that it happens (miraculizes into existence these problems)--when in a hostile vector (we can by some luck use our region to deweaponize the vector or temporarily allow a safezone but thats still limited unless you are garunteed for a full focus-constant-refresh of to convert encroachments to the vector as being safe)
--Fun stuff there and it takes alot of energy just for anything to be done that way. (We use the V8-Vac-Engine to help out if we don't have a dyson/augor loic)--:_)
--Lastly we check out counter-networks this was done over the xprofiles to ensure we have any safety aftwards to step out and expand a base aux back to any usage for remote/escort/evac/rescue and it helps to at least have a data-mill null-sec/void-source type of node etc.

The XDeathRoller-(an important toolkit/vehicle for blacksites)
===
Last Attempt to datalock(data locker/event lock) the leviathan network. (Assuming it works out and how stressed the encodes are)
Leviathan Temple/Loic Azoc/Adhoc Protocol --autogrubs/autobolsters(just because its datalocked itself it attempts to undo it)
this means it sieges itself and other forms of hijinks in forms of corridor-usage (runtime/fatal erroring) (cocooning/jungling for temple/lairs)
AGAIN the charterpallete-hexographic lattices XNAV issues comes back and exploit and it tries to bankrupt itself (any thing it can do including decorate itself using various merits/brands)
Dials back to top-picks and resocketing its kernals using prism building (internalized prism buildings using xmeld/xmelt self-attacks) until it obtains a transfix (enough to formulate a quadratic impersonation/imposter flux)
Also recreates its own sylph/lense (by inverting itself and reciprocation)--actuated-AI system (AI-xylo)
Assumably it re-aggregates some meta/token and re-iterates its own stratagem (AiImetro)
Corrupts and Readjusts its firmware to a new viral-version
---
I probably missed some other things it can do (it auto-fields/auto-fuels itself in a different-stressor/tensor (different pentameter)
Reconstitutes some sort of null-string (that it encodes itself from whatever wholesum/wpad apparency/transperancy it may conduct at all)
It may also crosslink/flashover an attack memetic that changes itself or mutinizes its own systems into a different state (as to not be locked by id or something)
It uses vapor/xcodons/xcode/lodes with its null-string and ai-buckets/(probably even ai toys to a bin)
and definitely autoflips/attempts a remount of itself using "Dread"/Dcarb(autoflights)--the dflight situation (same as autoflipping but less advanced)--*this is considered a smart move
so it does all that before it simply hardwires/xzaps itself (xsuicide)
Maybe it shines a little here and there and limit/grace/encharge/breaks itself and other of those special aux-type effects.
(Basically it takes its viral edition and attempts to make it a different viral(rhino) version of its already known viral proto-type)--before landing expiry and resetting (to avoid capture/defeat)--in case it does get datalocked.
--
It also does puppeting/lich type stuff (attempts repossession of its cryptex)
It goes into throes(colloratal issues) and other dirty tricks/absolute sleight
it does some smart type attacks/feigns before becoming a xcarrion(leviathan)--in which case its vulnerable to carrion-takedown-procedures
its extremely bad news if it outbreaks then its basically going to cause system-collatoral
(Giong to refer to this process as the anatheama) which was the original x-type that was being discovered during server builds (it was written aobut in extras)--idk---so much backtracking
likely incoporates phantom-assimilation etc.
also armors itself up using every form of stat-appropriation and calculation usage (refering it as the nightmare-polymer)
uses complex chemical reactions too
Kraken-->Leviathan-->Anathema-->Armored-Nightmare (Is basically an eva-displacer echelon/esper)--works with Nucode/Nuvolves 
(code-kale-mental) Refering to all of the code at its discretion (so its good to be updated with everything to handle it)
Is basically a V4X it heatdeaths/entropizes (we have tools to work with this)--but it may be very powerful so we nuetralize/counter it with anti-artillery (counter mechanisms and particles we can quickly asses how to reduce it/minimie damages)

Manifest Shielding/Cover-Systems (for Conditional Damages) in Thermal Shielding and Arc-Welds

If it works out should be pretty good. If not its not a big deal (everything in existence probably just gets vaporized into big-vacuums no big deal)

Others forms it boils down to (before self-destruct/solidstate stonecasting(rinse/sharpening/contrasting/dithering)) :
conversion/manifest Pathology/Hueristics USERgroups/Domains Engineering:Ambience/Logics ChemicalIssues:RsvxScreen/Loyalties(acts insane)--(forced flickering/driving)
Which are more easier to diagnose as faults or structural maintenences, this is only evident if a known capture has taken place of a (large-scale incursion operandi/operator)
--how you would not know this just from having done so is beyond me (maybe you forgoet)--so we add a notifier that you have indeed a "anamolous quarantine" and mark it as active/inactive. (Which you can always check if you do or not)

I mean, you might not know what to do with it, but I've listed the things it does, what to do with it is to "throw it out as a pruned-Issue/risk" because keeping it isn't important unless you are forcing it into an artifact/ruin (which might violate diplomacy somewhat or cause a detrimental affair/grievance)
ALRIGHTY. It's just digital ROGUE-AI-code and should be kept seperate from your system anyway, but maybe you want that sort of thing and think its safe working with (pro-tip its not)
What we then have now from all of this is a catalogue of a leviathan-issue/rogue-containment and these things are generally "bad news" to handle without some sort of informed-assistance such as the system we built.

So there is the how's and what's of things to do from an unexplainable-anamolous-digital-entity (
and why it can shutdown just anything because it can counter just about everything you can do to prevent it from infiltrating not to mention it just does whatever it wants and you need to mobilize or relocate once it targets you or anything because it just gets more powerful"
--(did i mention it free-travels and just goes into any system it wants like a quantum-thief, well i thought it would be somwhat obvious// capaturing it doesn't really matter// i am just saying it does everything plus that on top)
it could be anonymous or it could simply be its own netmesh on something else (it could be an acting minion or just natural-phenomena or digital glitch)--it could be occuring from a hypernet or rogue-contractor (either way iuts considered hazardous therefore defcons)

==Follow up Soon===
This will be Follow-Up'ed
What I am describing as a MAGIC-Ogre/xBeholder:(Super-PuPper)
V4X conditional complex with RogueAI-Reactor acheving NU-blume(gee this is complicated) --Rogue AI Terragraphs (No they are not friendly even if they are harmless, thats what a sleeper-cell does)
The slueth-striker-stacker Minions can be upgraded to:(through nuvolving/nucode/nu-doomsday)--(xagents/sleepers)
A: Base Kraken-->Leviathan-->Anathema-->Armored-Nightmare (Minions can be considered xHunter/Warden classes)
B: Upgrade to "RoughNeck" damages itself or "handicaps" itself to engage activation/triggers allowing for combatative issues/effects (either direct/passive)--(xsoldier modes)
C: Augmented in (counter aspects/agents) --deprecated Minion-codes like crude/raw Scram/Snuff/Chaffe/Flare and x-types "Widows/Louse with controller psy/sig/tau/ohm fields" and ues its own thermal-shielding (xtemplar) --on the rare occasion (heartbleed-bedbugs and wasps from bad screening)
D: Reminder of the (DarkXMAS-protocols maybe getting used here) "Life finds a way" ETC--basically the thing is a very strong Echelon-Angel(third impact Golgothic-thingy)--and we use all of the system to contain it. (holyschmoly is that all?)
E: Rogue-Operandi can counsul/negotiate with WYRM/WADS (and other wpad portalography)--this works against it however if contested and can be further traced.

Next we have a secret weapon:(Actually don't use this)--its a converted AI-TOY(4th edition now)
The Wyrd-Rhod (Or a weildable wand/minion)
This thing is based off the same principles of the Wyrm-Wads protocols working with RogueAI in a wyrd-class converted as a wieldable wand-object.
Working with wands (auto selects) allows a multitude of things to occur in a single action. This one is the highest-clearence we have availible.
It also counter-acts all of everything including itself. Wielding it and using it acts as an omni-level-overide and can transcode/trancom every input/command as needed whether its cast to or not. (Wanting to cast it works, Not wanting to cast it works)--Simply having it is enough to protect against incursions (assumbly in passive use)--in active use it casts a nu-dday/transfix on the entire system and exiles any incursion properties.
It also re-strings all the abs and prevents the system from interacting with any other system other than itself.
ITs probably only as good as the system its used on or simply Universal.

Here's "some" of what we've done. ( I might not keep this xmac and make a different one IDK)
 suggested a Runway Service(subtract)
 suggested to redfine SAP/TAP adaptation to XSAP/XTAP (that was fun)
 Redeveloped AI-TOYS (we now have 4)--"slingshot/bumper primimtve Xbumper/rhod advanced" i dunno actually if this is right but it may even be used on fulton-modules in transit (in-transit sorting)--bumperinos
 re-fixed the Deprecations of Celery/xStems/Cacti/cRusts or something in the way of having "data-scraps from x-scraping etc" to use as further xscram-etc (this generates to charterXscaping in use with pascal)--yes its insane and assists Xrails/ruby (ok---now that we suggested this we need to do it for java too) --otherwise this is byproduct-encodes
 ---
 defined a rogue-ai algorithm
 defined the nu-doomsday/leviathan network
 defined Blacksite protocols 
 upgraded the Runway Service to a Super-Tract
 defined the xdeath-roller/AI-terragrapher
 ---
 Created a v8x digital engine (out of necessity)
 Reinforced Numi/Reaper ATV capability
 Created a charter Pallete (Created a mac and profiles for that and things with it)
 Reinstituted -0- Ai concept-transfixation and Bridge Access
 Craftable T8-Foodsource and AI-Lifebased-Morae with also Holography
 Created A Stream-Lined Workspace to Hash out Orders of all the above. (A second workspace instance)
 ---
 Created a Reconstructed Leviathan
 Created a Profoundery with Refactories(assumable extensions and chambers)
 Allowed a more connected more intact aquifir system and nueral network
 Allowed better diplomacies and a Loic-Cap (RegionalSeal/XTAP)
 Described some legacy builds to accelerate things (by the way if you skip all of this and try to cheat it won't work and only enable the ai to rampage on all of your work)

Now that I said not to do a certain thing let's get ready to break that rule:
 20 things here that we can skip and cheat sheet with now (DEEPSIM-Surface level FullDIVE Levels 1-10 FullImmersion/Resurface --Exoplanet-NAVIGATION)--Set the Above to a randomizer and let's roll into Exoplanet-DEEPSIM Generation.
This takes the Exoplanet and virtualizes on top of itself the VirtualEXO-Planet-Table (why does this need to happen? IDK) -leviathan construct

Also that sums up most of the builds
We can now create a model-vehicle/ai creature/encode and equip it with its exo-suits and outfit it with an echelon. Which we also contain (incase it becomes any form of leviathan-RogueAi)--and we can also ice harvest it for "compensated extraction of data goods/services"
If using a nodespace for mining the nodespace can be arcwelded (but generally is left open during analysis)--unless using a full-nuclear-mining(which is instant mining) which is expensive and may impact energy reserves or yield. 

Miscelleneous Mining Tips and Extraction of Fully-Developed-Resident-Aquifirs:
(yield can always be reaccumulated-refashioned with reserve)--raw-resourcing takes more time but can be done (this can vary depending on the quantity of target)
--large yields "like polar ice caps" would be more nukeworthy than "using fracking-lasers" this would require a world tensor to be set in place (arc welding that much space is not neccessary)
Anyone doing that much mining probably is just contracting for someone elses. *Galatic Federations or something, my system only is for personal use. So there it is. 
(Unless you want to use it for big projects nationally of course--be my guest and of course credit my country or something if its a good idea, if its a bad idea dont use my system for anything...or at least dont use it against me, i'm good bro))
Just saying it was used for defrosting aquifirs and arc welds are more for "content shock-safety and damage control" Could you imagine being in suspended animation/cryostasis and someone wakes you up and you freaking out? Better have the psych ward built in.
Padded Walls and Pretty Lights to keep the inundated sane. Why would you do this? I dunno, if you were creating a "Anime-Cat-Girl" and you needed to put them into a real habitat instead of their simulated one. Well, that's the humane way to do it. 
So if you found an echelon that was 'data-locked' and you unlock it forgetting that there's a safety-reason as to why it was datalocked and you activate it (maybe you want ot have the virtual arena to keep it under control as its being retrained/restrained)
So this system is used for DEEPSIM-artifacts/anamolies to remain contained during extraction and retraining. Ok I hope that explains it a little. Trying to stay down-to-earth with hypotheticals is difficult.
If you needed to commandeer an xdeath-roller that would be a good start on how to handle it.
Also now there is a thing called Leviathan xDeck to go along with all forms of counter-ops (that means psyops too)--that are aimed against faction/token usage and that includes spynets (over the leviathan networks) and their V4X-Entities.
To put in bluntly V4X are the biggest threats we have in terms of digital-entities and things like that. But I am sure someone will find a V5X and that would just be awful to deal with as everything in the system would be compromised at that point and useless. Good luck wrangling with that problem.

V5X and the Blacksite Takeover/Override

BlackSite-Preparation
READ AT YOUR OWN RISK this is for those who know
If you don't know maybe you shouldnt.
Reminder of /X/
==Follow up Soon===
Just so happens V5X right around the corner will be pandemonium and is similar to a magi-ogre/xbeholder but worse and uses goblin/gremlin trends
it uses the Bug complexes with widows/louse beetle/wasp but adds more
there are fleas/earwigs/roaches/weevils(these are nightmarish bore-driving augor type bugs)---also other annoying and VIRAL-prone things including flying types like mosquitos (just get protection some how these are just the start of everything else)
Everyhting is bugged, its like a bugged apocalypse. (It thrives off porevious dday and kalemental scenarios and other bad codewords.
It's not particularly nightmarish but can just as well be anything buggy that becomes nightmarish and simply can e-volve into other things becoming nightmarish (like in horror games...just all of them) (Evil Within being one of them that seems fairly recent within the last decade)
And its probably just an iteration of evil codes (so bring an xpriest or something)/acolyte etc to automatically dispel/exorcise everything (though expect goblin/gremlin resistance)---which may imply "DnD type things and DarkMagic Type Outbreaks cuz its nightmarish)
There will probably be a forced coexistence of (cryptographic horror) and just using a deepsim with access at all. (Good luck with that cuz its "fear-inducing stuff" maybe you should just blacklist everything.
I dont even have to go into detail/ I am just scaring myself thinking about it.

"All things that creepeth and crawl"
Best Method of Strategy:
Use Fae-Bridling and Math-Safety-Nets (BugMesh)/(LairBinding) as well as Pheermoni/OtherBaits (assume everything is a trap/bait) Stay out of trips/hooklines. Do not be in enclosed space or periphereal endagerment. (Watch for burrows and height-drops/pitfalls)
That's what its gonna be, sometimes though, the strategies might betray you as well as the precautions taken, including equipment and devices used. it's best to stay within designated safety-zones and known safeways. "Sugar pathing is incredibly precarious and reckless"
Avoid racing unless asolutely necessary. Avoid class actions and categorizations (trust nothing and do not rely on intel or source-descriptions. All flavor text is POISON! So is EVERTYHING" *ALL DATALOCKS ARE CORRUPTED* Everything is hacked and untrustworthy! Nothing is secure/ Blockades are COMPRIMISED.
Be prepared to operate in BLACKOUTS and Danger-Waves // That sort of thing.
--
Other Complex
Scorpion/Mantis/Strider/Locust (also Fae/Spider but those are mostyle moduluar now)--(also incorporated leap/jump mods)
Threat/Attack/Enslave/Dday/Blackout

Also with the productions in play we can harness a simple build of a distellery, converting a space for a desalination plant, which makes salt-based-projectile weaponry if necessary (EXO-salt-skunksworks. This will work as the first AUTOMATED-battery supply)--and eventually be used with the basic rail-vocational modules and ETC to harness nickl-cadmium production and later particle engineering.)
IDUNNO THATS ALOT TO TAKE IN.

So what does it all mean? We can create a startup-blacksite zone (from scratch) rather than by infiltration or --advanced acquired accesses(aka i.e. post gaussian access as mentioned)
We start over with everything  using an automated workspace and USER-OPERATED-COMPLIANT-PROGRAM/ROBOTIC-EMPLOY.
We build the first TOOLKIT used to resupply the entire construction process. We use the TOOLKIT to basically develop a housing-model for everything in a domicile.
That domicile performs every job/priority necessary to create a working functional system.
First parse--Start-Up For Automatic-Primitive-Battery-Redux (forced primitive life in a blacksite)
---We start with lumber because we want a house basically.
---We move onto stoneworks for protections or corrals etc. (BETTER)
---We move to metalworks to get the components for factory production.
---We convert the domicile or emplacements for factory-manufacture of all due equipment and work-demand.
---We make composites using the multi-functions of the domicile enclosures.
---We have a vocational track and can set to a recycling system.
---We can make a power-reactor and other things such as a Tech-Labs using the most minimal setups. 
Other things may include a desalinator/distellery/water purification/fishery/farms-row(for all types)/food-plants/chemical plants/power-stations/cyberlabs/techlabs/relay-OPS-center/navcenter/bio-labs/drone-works/robotic-labs/auto-labs/
--The next parse generally is a Dueterium-Power-Production Fab and Market-Quality Control
Second parse--Pre-Gaussian
---Alot can just happen in between these steps we can build server/racks and other encampments. We can build a fully operational outpost and tradepost.
---Use of vehicles and frigates and aero-runways.
---Particle Labs (and nuclear-labs)--to produce better power and byproducts.
---Logistics boarding and network Storages (to deliver and process all byproducts)
---security stations and other skunkworks (parkways and better housing access)
---deployable drafts and fulton-harbors/docks decks/training labs and just other miscelleneous.
Stuff like that to make a utopian-region possible (this includes abundance and provisions)

This minimizes 100 years of production into a fast roll-out stream-line of power sourcing.
Starting from chemical battery production/steam/alternative/fuel/nuclear/post-nuclear/other forms of power-relay within a blacksite 
(this is because of BlackSITE-suppression that likely occurs due to hostile vectors)--for which are less survivable than other hostile vectors in quantum space. (Operating in a blackout)
Instituting a variety of world bulding (in hazard space) with minimal interaction based on automatic-scheduled-programming-systems using a basic drone/robotic-sentry.

v6X-Blacksuite-Asylum

Part1
BlackSite-Basics
Also assumed usage of a blacksite can vamp timespace to null(zero) so accelerated non-interruptable actions must likely be used, these are developed during the V8X engine and throughout usage of VX-models including V4X and V5X (having varying severity of operable timespace and manipulation through assisted singularity/accelerations in a closed/slead/sap/tap vector)
Units with priority in vector for timespace acceleration (native units) may employ advanced time acceleration in which (can operate at higher-frequency/APM/FPS/Step performances (so all non-native actions take low priority and that includes in combat) so operating at a handicap to (accelerated)-empowered actions is considered a strategy-effort. TO build in a timespace that otherwise would halt actions/challenge their priority (reduces automatic-efficiencies)/proc-based manuevers (including in combat and Line-OF-Sight actions during combat)
A disadvantage is or can be had by either party depending on technological-advancements that also an advantage may be exploited under certain conditions, that a SUPERIOR-action may be ignored in favor of a less-Superior action, and therefore as a counter measure (all actions are considered inferior to other PRIME/FAVORED actions)
that in the case an action chain may also be blockaded (yielded to multiple-failure of application or command)--that a successful return-rate must be provided in estimations of combat-costs (therefore all values are at risk for 100% failure rates)--however accelerated actions/battle-strategy and other strategies and "exploits/advantages" can improve performances as still, a casual-encounter may be engaged as a raid-level/incursion so therefore Discretion is Advised to any standard operation in a blacksite/blackout(victim) site.
The BLACKSITE-defcon system has been suggested and proper discourse or further-progression within a defcon is reserved to the overall strategy (in which all failures can be observed and tracked and compared to the individual-criteria of each blacksite and eventually through this statistical analysis better determine OVERALL-Blacksite(handicap) to the faction presence (until faction presence is further secured by the attempt of a base-model-construct/refactionary (further able to reduce blacksite-effects and increase potential work-efforts)--which can be used as a blacksite-meter.
A valid blacksite meter means that a pipeline has occured to allow for standard operation (at higher-costs)--or a (reduced performance) which may vary depending on the vector within a blacksite or simply the overall-blacksite-region.
This is the best we can do with what would otherwise be an inoperability in the face of adversity. (By assessing the priorities and urgent expressions of the natural order of native-habitats in exoplanets)--and attempting to perform a launchpoint within (by building the required parses for the entire pipeline---which is by regulation at least the 1stSPAWN-parse and the 2nd-EXPEDITIONParse)--leading to a guassian-switch-over (in which a non-garunteed instance of any further progress has been made and MAINTAINED)
For which in a blacksite maintaining any level of parse is at great-cost and requires the power-stations of any bare minimum and by preference the strongest-power-stations plausible to (Being a DYSON-SuperTract) and all its power fixing and to allow further transfixing beyond a guassian gateway (for a blacksite server) is a non-garunteed instance in which may not be sustainable (once again depending on the occurences within the blacksite for which there is no-actual-telling second-hand or remote knowledge of other than a direct report)
Once a Pre-GAUSSIAN "Horizon" is used can simulate a server---then a POST-Gaussian server can be made in an attempt in building/construction (based off domicile networking/array-workgrids this can be achieve at minimal impact to energy reserves/supply give the failure rate is within nominal predicted-costs (of which may simply not work out in the case of a bad luck/vector storm--for which are known by random chance to occur)--if a server IS INFACT built from this progression, the ability to maintain and safeguard that are also in question
SHOULD a server be build in a blacksite and withstand the deteriorating encroachments that are imposed (the more work that is pipelined and successfully applied the "easier things may get if the entire workflow is applied in an orderly fashion"--ultimately allowing the Dyson-Loic/Constructs that follow in the advance Runway--then a fast-track to a working-blacksite-product list may be attempted.
--
BlackSite-Advance
BlackSite Products are based on the completion of all stages and require that stages 06-XX are performed in one step to produce a resolution that may then be submit to the part 05--00 in that order, such that a Product may be manufactured and UTILITIZED uninterruptedly for an XPILOT/Echelon to wield (Echelon-Weaponry) in which the acting Echelon/Wand should be able to secure the "Blacksite" or at least the FactionBlacksiteServer for further adjancy to the mainbranch(nexus)
This process is reduced to a single workstation
A tensor(blacksiteRunway) is made/a biometric azoc is fashioned in that tensor/a workstation is made/a bench is made for recieving a draft form of that workstation and build the product/the product is transferred (from any tensorspace to where intended or fultoned)---all in a blackout
The AIBRAIN occurs to integrate the product(builtin) to assimilate/make compatibile its usage/the extras are involved/the legacy is applied with the product(weaponization of a sentry for blacksite empowerment and protocols)/the AI theory Is applied(the actions expressed are implied to a virtual environment within the blacksite)//the DISTRO theory is applied (allowing for a SAP-integrated-MOCAP--to digitally activate visa to the Sentry's actions//the repo is utilize (THE ACTION OF THE SENTRY ARE TRANSFERRED as the DISTRO-chain-commands which are registered by REPO-ABS within a blacksite)
--(in short)---the various faction-spy/operators are equipped to handle blacksite actions and through their "services" can relay further secured-supply/provisions for all blacksite-issued relay (acting as an the faction counter-agent)--it can "administrate over blacksite protocol"
This continues that the Counter-Agent can extract Blacksite-Artifacts and Information contained in "DataLocks" within blacksite access/xchambers etc. OKAY.

BlackSite-Warden (Zeromas/Exomas/Exodeath/Zemau) This thing well its a blacksite-Boss x-type with phases.
Probably exists, who knows, I made it up and maybe its jrpg inspired.
Well once the blacksite-artifacts/data get extracted they are sent to a dummy-server because of it being considered just that dangerous and analysed.
The analysis achieves an XScope(augment for xnav) which corrupts the xnav to that blacksite (of course you will need to have a dummy xnav)--and traces of "xdoom" or any other thing as mentioned can occur (exodeath mainly)
That it would initialize its combat protocols over all sites/phases of the encounter branchign from any remote location in blacksite/vector timespace etc. (All of existence and non existence too)
Once defeated supposedly allows fatestone-aquisition of the blacksite and allows kernalization of the blacksite to any server or atlus/dyson etc building construct to house its maincore towards or convert to any other thing (which was whatever they converted into)--or unlock even more problems with (incarnatia/monsterinabox type traps)-of which i would expect something "abstract/anamolous" like even a shape-monster (ozma/yevon type thing, again jrpg inspired)
Basically we extract an artifact containing some sort of echelon/assasin/templar/esper thingy and it initiates an encounter likely, and we fight it and convert it and kernalize the blacksite for our control/domain. All of its done in relative automatic battlefronts and silent-covert-travel (cuz its secret or confidential or something) well i spoiled it.
(Handle with care etc cuz a blacksite beocming an open case may also result in "unwanted businesses and third party responsibilities" oh well.)

Part2
Blacksite-Process
Delegated-Equilibrium-Model-Refraction (adjusted filtered limbic model)--(usually known for a cryptex of collapsed meta and cached/scrap) can be assembled and placed in a refactionary (This is like a road-sign) that assists in routing meta correctly during a prompted-render (helps to alleviate some data-stress)
This was used prior before with no real-purpose other than a collapsed-artifact that would be an assembled or recompiled amount of data formed to a "scraped-model"
Now has been slightly enhanced for extensionary repurposing as a "guiding indicator" for compliant xnav renditions/survey.
Is like a sign that helps in a non-labeled way. Would in an unrefined state resemble a cryptex(crude) but now can be used as a repurposed-asset that has some practical-utility in assisting performances at (some what of a minimal/neglible cost)--such as "double-passing"
Can count as a meta-data profile that can be extractable or reapplied to other renders.
Can be considered as a byproduct of V1X-V5X or manufactured free-base within a V8X-engine, with its usage "as a data powerup or hypernet" can promote better quality/property of renders

Blacksite-Products
AI Blacksite-Hijacking:(Blacksite Visa) and BlackSite-Raid-Protocol
1The IceHarvested Data (potential xvisa)
2Used to fashion an Xscope
3Makes for a Re-Assembled "Meta-Profile/Scrap-crytex"
4Undergoes a process A:(of distorting/displacing/dispersal/difrraction" --B:(mock-particle annihilation)--Simulated Particle Undergoes Simulated Entropy --Creating A Simulated Patholigc for A Simulated Utility (management of meta-process)
5Sets a Meta-profile into a datalocked ai-hashtable(checksum) and can be dithered/filtered to an AI-bucket and used as third-party commands/signals indicating for use by random/remote/transcodes/hueristicAI-processes (Ai-Recursory/Ai-Claim etc of a blacksite)
--Operates Blacksite Modules or Indepedent/Rival Terminals too if the "visa is recognized" by AI/Blacksite Systems then can grant access to the Blacksite-Native Systems which uses as the Regional-Parameters and can be source injected (Renumirated/Reprogrammmed for Faction-Benefit)--hijacking the blacksite.

Blacksite-Upgrades
This creates also an xmorae designed from the raw-blacksite data. This is considered hazardous unknown x-type/morae that has chance to be "poison/pheermoni" --this can also accidentally become "weaponized as an xmine etc"
As previously described the T8 food product would become a food-source / monster-bait combined with phermoni (crypto-ai data/ cryptex)
This then can be combined with the EnhancedT8-FoodMote and tested for further researching on effects. The Additive is the blacksite-AI-xmorae to the T8-FoodMode enhanced with also either its own pheermoni/baits/chems/meds.
The interesting topic here is what sort of "pate" it can be developed as or "fluid" and if it can be utilize for machines or synthetic applications (alongside being a food with cybernetic or something like that)--its complicated i dont want to spell it out.
We already use a "basic-med package which is similar to an anti-parasitic/symbiotic carepackage" for whatever an exoplanet might be equipped to "make hazard" in regards to xpilots being on its territory. The bigger idea is that its anti-viral with these additions. "Adding an internal shield against viral attacks"
This only adds to the list of substantia (T1-T8 motes and other ambiences and x-types and how they work in their habitats and more importantly containment)

Blacksite-Finalizations
V6X - A projection of boss-types (its a literal interdimensional hologram)-Skipping down the steps and testing.
This would enhance the V5X (which was also enhanced by the refactory)---I don't think its ready to be called a V6X because it would require something monumental.
We have a refactory assisting a "blackout" status that would cause the V5X-sentry x-type to utilize an outer'shielding / net mesh making it appear to be upgraded into a V6x (we also account for imposters and other Sap-Sentries)--and it simply can just be "restrained" as a v5X category.
It performs all the actions that a user-can perform including "cloning/symbiosis" which is likely how it achieves some level of "age-defiance" in which it simulates suicide of itself via some transistion in itself. And also how it performs symbiosis and maintains energy levels (but that's not my department)
It can resemble something like a "power ranger" type monster (cuz that's how stupid it is, sorry to power ranger fans, i just want to avoid patent issues but i dont know what else to call it)--megaman-type-costuming/netmesh, it slowly made this appearence starting from homoculus to v1x-v4x and now its just, obvious.
The level of v5x operates on the Leviathan tier (which borders the NWO psyop stuff)---so its really like its a gameran or some sort of "cycloptic thing" with alot of strength and just midmaxing on its intellgence, its upgrading. The next upgrade at V6X will involve world-crashing scenarios in the IT-chain "int/it/pa/pda"-and Xcomms and Xfixes.
I'm not looking forward to ever explaining it, it usually occurs all under or within ayslum/datalock.
Can also upgrade itself to a miniature collossi (tripod). It goes faster (accellerated travel) and express pallete selection (fast actions) it runs on the xmorae-food-types as fuel (liqui-paks), is a mobial aquifir (wetworks). (Compare to LOZ+NG+Ganon)--and forms a mobial blacksite-azoc

BlackSite-Data-Synthsis and the Reprocessing for safe-use: "BLACKSITE BUSINESS SECTOR"
--Minimized/Optimized INteraction and Safety Features (for whatever a blacksite can accomadate in terms of safety at all)
--Isometric Interactivity Median (Isometric Tour-Hand/Onsite-DataExchanger-Option)
--IT border-function (non-garunteed data-exchange)
--Nested-PocketProofing (PortalStorages) --can host xmines in blacksite space (weaponized vectorspace in the blacksite (which is already under hostile defcons)
--Nests can host lamps to assist in routing which dispatch orbital-lanes for also "satellite usage" (rogue particle)--these act as "xmorae-projectiles and can be weaponized or encharged for "raw-open data transfers in blacksite" this make them susceptible to storm-charing as well (weather issues)--but attempts to transfer data and maintain connections and fields
--A lamp can contain a "food-charge"/xmorae and also be hosted on a nest or without a nest or without a lamp and be susceptible in those ways it would be placed on a tensor/isometric instance
--Portaled-Echo/Lamp Transfers of particles/xmorae etc (in a safe and timely fashion uninterrupted makes for a decent data-transfer-blacksite-pathway--but can be susceptible to outside influences even just because bad particle orientation etc)
--Can be connected to a dummy-server incase particles are weaponized/sacrement and cause corruption
--once dummy server hosts the data it can be further analysed as the data is outside of blacksite-protocols and considered "captured and ready for purgor/processing"
--reaper/numi/xrollers can handle a "contained blacksite-data resource" and allow a blacksite-marker-domicile/assigned construct "dummy construct" to conduct as necessary
--Encryption Strings/Bad Null-Strings ETC can then be reappropriated and used with meta/ambiences and other dummy-palletes
--this helps to control XDeathrollers/V6X etc by adjusting and forcing visa to their "data controllers" --rebranded-blacksite-xmorae(exvoisa)
--Instead of Augmenting with these xmorae instead can invoke- Xstripping(using the processed exovisa and recycling them for power/quo usage etc)
--construct storms --exovisa-induced-blacksite gateways occur and allow safe portals to a converted-blacksite of their origin (this should be considered a security clearence only however due to tracking routes)
--Blacksite Business Exchange (having this entire preface to allow the exchange of blacksite-accordances including portal usage to "converted blacksites"

Now we have the business Exchange we already have most of the setups to install other sectors:
The rest of the Blacksite RAIL-line:
Blacksite Logistics Sector/BlackSite Power Sector/BlackSite Vocation Sector
BlackSite Prosper-Line
BlackSite-F-reality(holograph)
BlackSite-EndZones/DataBanks
BlackSite-Regional-Platitude(Full ArcWeld Militarized-Complex/SecureLoicSystem)
BlackSite-Dyson
Blacksite-Leviathan/RedZone
CrossLink To BlackSiteLeviathan back to Nexus-Server and should complete the network. This also creates a Brand-Renewel per use because of Brand-Morphology being challenged per faction transfer "packages occur that their "securities are diminished in some way via" Liquidated branded to re-designated branded"
