DISCLAIMER
THIS ENTIRE SET-DOCUMENT IS BASICALLY AN OPTIONAL PACKAGE (and not necessary for an operation)--this is the *(delux packaging so to speak)

XX-Runway-Tunnel-Subtracter --- Making Platform Abstraction from a Dyson Mega-Cube--(HyperCubic VR Projection) to (A Full Simulation)--Using an Augment-Data-Reactor
Support and Congruent Quantum DownFlow (Exchange Networking) (mmmmmmmkkkkkkkkkay) to combining them as a Dyson-Turbine (Yeah probably not happening but Quantum Teleportation)
*(also um its sort of a railroad for spies that are hostage)

We have developed a complicated dyson simulation system (with hosted simulation space)
Now we are going to extend the capabilities of that system to a "better prompt" and stylizer that works as an all in one formatting for custom contracts (request or submissions)

******************************************************************************************
The Full Dyson Construct (ExoNav)
******************************************************************************************
Part 1 Dyson-Vrx-Platform (Upgrading the Legacy: Rail and Prosper and Region) + (NuAIRx) to the Dyson-Vrx-Engine Etc) as "Nu-Region"
Dyson Rail:(A)
Shortcut "Tunnel"/Runway System
Partition Space Dedicated for Fast Tracking File-Generation (Incorporated to a Dyson Pod-Share Brief Simulation)
Works as a Remote-Live-Mail Fetch and Bulletin System (Quest Timer)
Acts as a Farewell-Negotiation (To a BonVoyage)/HelloWorld --FairwayLaunchProtocol of DeepSim/Xsynch with Xcode-Ejection
Full Emissionary Detailer - Ricochet-Rebound xSplasher (Buffering Service)

Dyson Prosper "WorkPoint":(B)
Applies a Nu-Assortment Code Inject (Hyper-Railed)/Accelerated
Runs off main rail assortment to meta-prosper-assortment (joint operative)

Performs Class Priority Data Sweep (Specialized Preset/Macro Allocation)
Class-Template Prioritization to Class Template Prioritization --Reverse-Compatibility of hardwire Version (Specialized Firmware-Subtract)-Applicator
(Low Impact - Full Dive / Fulton / LiftOff) Multi-Selection and Preferential Profiling (Specialized Search Indexing)

Part 2 (Applying A Reactor Augment // Acting as Extension to a Working Dyson-Platform) -- (Dyson Server Casing and Header for Deep Sim Data Exchange "Dyson Runtime Network")
Dyson Component Region-Locker (similar to f-layer on region built for dyson):(C)
Model-Suggestive Preset and Itemization of Request/Contract (Inventorial Negotiation) - Imperitive CheckSystem
Dyson-Augmented-Reactor (Very nice) + System Life-Support + (System Directory Organizer and Firmware Compatibility List)
Works in Tandem with (A)(B) and StandAlone as (C)--best to have all cylinders.

Part 3 (Part1+Part2)
Real Time Exchange Service of Contract-Custom-Dyson-Sim "World Seed" Aggregate-Access

Almost Forgot to put this into the document of Part 3
Is better to have a dedicated Reactor handle this Extension or at least a Main-Central-Nexus
Optional Easy Case-Extension-Adapter for Tap/Vpn and Interception-Via-DataDistellation (5th Chain Data Model) --Can be Turned Off/On (Works with Data-Inteceptor and Network-Stackable)
--"Dilutes Data into Packet Chunks for Reassembly after Quantum Teleportation" and Recompiles based on Build-Protocols Of Site-Transcode (Based on Credential Api-Secure Usage) --or something.
Translates 3rd Party or Affiliate/Partnered Trusted Information into a Clear-Access-Framework (which then acts as Central HUD)--for all information transfer (informative filters or protocol-operandi)
With Bypass Strict to Pipeline Priority (Preferential Data-Feed) Uses Lots of CPU+RAM (OVERCLOCKED or TURBO) it uses most and more than all usually VirtualRAM and Availible Ram (Full OVERHAUL) which should be mitigated by Network Dataflow-Limits (Pref-Buffering)
Similar to SD-Options (And Attention Preferences to DataLoads) --Can cause system hangs (Usually Choppy Stream But can be fixed if dedicated and "untampered" connection is mostly streamlined for this particular process 
(server-distrubted data-feeding)--think of it like tightening suspensions until they are more or less over-loaded and pop off but allows to cheat weight limits. It can be throttled to avoid detection (which will sometimes autokick a connection
therefore connections must be also -reconnected)--once it clears up it can be "auto adjusted" under known stressors (within acceptence or exemption) --it will then still maybe cause a system hang or (fast rejection due to exception being recognized)--if this occurs it can be default to normal speeds
That is why its optional (it isnt necessary to have this extension to utilize aggregate-access)--it just helps if the system is allowed to over-ride "third party limitations" by supplementing its own capability. (Other systems might not allow this due to permissions or securityissues)--IDK 
(It would take even more hacking to see if it would work afterwards anyways)--It doesnt always work because "obselete tech" or incompatibility or just plain "unable to compensate for this "extrenuated stress on a dataload"
It should actually be called SERVER-HUSTLING --imo that describes the kind of situation taking place.
---
We have an expected packet, we want to have it instantly, we want the packet to be as large as possible to reduce the request and speed things up---naturally other technology will not be able to take this into account and "desynch" or trigger a flag or something.
Unless it can then it will be instantly siphoned as much as possible per the request issued. See what I am saying? Oh well. It would basically "transport entire fleets worth of information at a time or basically a full space colony to instanteously be teleported if for instance, a world-ending situation occured or system freeze :P"
"Even my own computer can't do this "atleast 10% of the time anyway" 90% of the time it crashes on a game load while running this entire thing (Comparitively this entire thing I can run on my computer, plus just this little part here can crash my computer)
so of course I would reccomend an actual server setup for this (I run my poor computer like a server would be run lol i.e. Don't do that!)
So a server should be good enough for doing this.

Now we get to count back all the times we would have used the "data distellery". So of course we would use it here at the very end.
We would use also at the start of the interceptor development (if we had even known about it--protip:we did)
because we wanted to use it way way back during legacy--sometime during the extras-development (still writing that out right now)
So we know there are those three parts we can use it with. Somewhere In Legacy/Extras/and with the RUNWAY / + "and all the little places any time there would be data used anywhere"--which is EVERYWHERE ELSE.
Using the distellery with THE ENTIRE SYSTEM--+using it with an interceptor WILL DEFINITELY require a fully dedicated nexus (for which THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT)--by the time we use it at all, we should be working towards finalizing the DYSON-REACTOR + DYSON PLATFORM (which it can be used with either)
Using it with the full system and the ENTIRITY of all its version is where it will work out best!
----So now we prioritize it by parses that it will handle (SPECIFIC parses or all of the ones possible)--this will cover hundreds of layers of server-hosted-processing over several trays/stacks. So now we can just use it all over "1U RACK" for instance and that should cover everything mentioned more or less. I assume anyway.
I PERSONALLY DONT OWN A SERVER OR A RACK FOR IT BUT IF I HAD ONE I WOULD BE GLAD TO INCORPORATE THIS SOMEHOW TO IT. hint hint wink wink nudge nudge.

Now we are taking alot of data from our own data milling and all our parses on every layer we can and mixing it into a commodified data-chunk (for DEEP-SIM immersion/projection) I don't know what to say. We can call it a NuDyson/Nuvolver-Tray because it will be hosting at least one LOADOUT of the "METACHUNK" it makes. (Actually several, infact they will all make a server/shard for a cluster if not enough by themselves)
And that would require alot of data-distrubtion which we have pipelined for express-exchange and secured it over the Data registery / DATABANK of all the account/contracts that it can be used  to host someone's game (like a minecraft host) if they wanted (A DEEP SIM HOSTING SERVIVCE)--that's where the moolah would be anyway. (And its kinda a big deal if infact they were streaming out that entire "relm/shard" it would need its policy-coverage.
If you absolutely have to provide a launcher for the bare necessities or minimum experience for (aggregate-access via a server host)--that would they allow them to interact as "A CUSTOMER WOULD EXPECT THEIR EXPEIRENCE TO BE IN ALL GENUINE REGARD TO THE SERVICE PROVIDED AS ADVERTISED"
IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO make an OFFER-PAGE for them to order it by.

AND JUST SO HAPPENS --we already would have designed a POLICY with the CONTRACT/ACCOUNT anyway and just section out exactly what that entails for "Hosting a Product/Server Chain" for instance so they could play a GAME/COLLAB/REMOTE-CONNECT at all. (Think like an E-ARENA)--and it would be acceptable under contract permissions and rates. (For which they likely have providied the costs for)--being that of which was assigned by their party-membership ETC. (Let's rank it like Standard/Deluxe Silver/Gold/Plat ETC) That kind of thing.
And then the server would dedicate the processing availibility of that (for instance if in a server farm)--would dedicate a server tray/rack to allot for the usage expected of the "event"/"contract"
Pretty Easy to Understand Nothing Complicated about that. It does not need to be any more complicated than that on the business 
I am saying, oh you will need such and such percentage of an availiable server, here you go//it costs this much, type sort of agreement. Would be the situation there (with policy and regional regulations that apply of course)
I feel like the system I am describing works, for those that have a server to use it they would apply my theories in this way (And it would be a nice way about it)------------unlike some -other unnamed services out there---my way of doing it would be fair as I have already shown this lays out like.


SO LET ME GET BACK TO THE DISTELLERY PARSE AVAILIBILITY WOULD BE EASIER DESCRIBED IN SUCH A WAY ON AN OFFER PAGE
To OFFER SERVICES BY PARSE OR TYPE.
That would likely involve the generic layout of the rail/prosper/region/platform etc all of that. Breaks down into a menu of sorts.
It is more recomennded to SELL BY WORLD-EDITION than anything. OR BY A 1U SERVER RACK for the WHOLE OF EVERYTHING
GOOD LUCK WITH THESE OFFERS ANYWAYS:

Sorted by Tier and major sectors and World Edition: 
For the Rail: (60 or so)
(Note the first 40 are the entire Nexus-barebones Setup and should be its own OFFER for start-ups)
(The full rail is 60 or so and should also be its own offer for better jumpstart)

For the Prosper:(45 or so)
(The first 15 or so are for Basic-Automated-Launch Site Development and Colonization)
(The Second 15 or so are for Genetic Lab Biome Production and Travel)
These can both be in their own package or together. (For Advanced Colonization)
(The Last 15 or so are strictly Data-Trafficing and also require large amounts of battery/power sourcing if not sustained by a reactor)

Now We are Done, but WAIT THERE'S Even MORE! (*Screams Internally) Here We Go Again (Lovable Snark)
***********
(*and I can't stress this enough, *muffled screaming internally*)-(Programming Broiling Plot Development)
--*(Are we still "screaming internally? dramaticpause-It Would appear so Yes")

Service Announcements (Openings or Allotments):
Taking a Step back. We can see the potential to Utilize this program to replicate other programs.
Taking a file-type, breaking it down to parameters, and emulating a workflow (seems like a simple transcode)--which can be replicated on a surface level.

Contract Order/Pre-Production:
We can take a file--and integrate prompt into the selection, to REVERSE-Engineer or Re-Design its Resulting Product.
We can simulate settings/selections/preferences/programming through transcripting the file-types at a surface level (designating parameters and establishing a mock-up of its workflow)
IT help to ARLEADY be able to transcode the file directly, and using known file-types the "deductive processes can be alleviated or assisted".

Procedure/Methods:
For instance we want to change a movie to include certain properties of a prompt-given-request. "I want this movie to be more Cartoon-like or its Characters to be different based on my own Profiles of "Cartoon Characters"
For instance I want to "Remaster the Movie to be designed as a "Matrix-Like Post-Apocalypse" or include "A Noire-Setting BackDrop" throughout selected scenes. (This would take some Effort, but can be done)
We would expedite this process in a variety of ways, and the user could select via a Test-Sample or Template of "Easy-Access-Modulations"
So there we go.
What I mean by "a variety of ways"--is that either it would snapshot the instance or given frame-by-frame and re-engineer it based on prompt and post-renditions at a "Surface Level" or it would Intensively Emulate certain Transcripts which it would detect or have primed for application.
This would be called LIQUIFIX/INTENSIVE LIQUIFIX. (Surface to Encode Level Transcripting)

The Manufacture Process:
Injection of XCode Likely Occurs Here:(PREP)
We would attempt a "Liquifix" transcode --See what works, See what methods can be used in combination and apply them based off User-Prompted/Preferential Scheduling.
The next stage (apparently there is a next stage)--would be to use that as a template for further Liquifixing.
Using these "novel methods" we can generate a Emulation of a workflow (in either way if it works to the desires of the user than GOOD)--the user could attempt to "enhance" results through a resolved "CHROSS-SYNCH" of their Workflow with other Workflows (or provided original workflow with "the redesigned workflow")
(A)Liquifix and (B)Chross-Synching (Would then work together after-images all auto-adjusted templates and parameters (OMG just....w/e) and replicate a new product.
Make Cartoon Movie Like "the Matrix" with "Noir Settings" and use "new Cast members based off this list" <--/A/<-->/B/--> with such and such other properties (Subtitles or Different Resolutions and other Impromptu Editing Choices)
Injection of XCode Likely Occurs Here:(DRAFT)
Prefaced for Deep SIm Use--Would Involve an Easy-Case Sampling (and so on) given or generated of a Base-Model/File-Type/WorkFlow. (In which to incur upon a World Seed or End-Product for Dyson-Construct Usage)---(OK)-(Express-Adaptive-Dyson-Profile)-EPG-EADP-(Reserve-Power-Depletions)-Turbine-PreReqs/Check

******************************************************************************************
The Bonus World and Quarantines
******************************************************************************************
11th World Edition
Standard Level Quarantine--Typical Defcon Initialized per Entry
Fully Realized Casing (interal region)
Dyson-Reactor + LightWaveToroid--SuperCollidor(particle-handling)--Super-ParticleABS-ExoDataLab
The Dyson Block(with reactors) can fit into a crimped-creased plasma-toroid (this is designed over the reactor/module space around the block) 
(It is very large already, and can allow what would be a gravity-normalizer if it were a space-station 
(basically is that operating as a plasma centrifuge fueled by the dyson and reactor power supply)--it also boosts power
The toroid may be stacked for all world tiers (Primal-Rem/Quantum-Virtual/Quasi-Crypto/Zero-Delemental ETC) 
Its worth at least 4stacks each would be 1U-Rack EACH Just for safety---(works with most comergent functions)--in 4 stacks (can be more or less depending on how its fashion--can include null-sec/info-sec/ai-sec/it-sec ETCX)
The toroid can be built wholly over an emplaced dyson as well (Functioning and fully integrated allowing for entrance to the dyson where necessary)-if necessary
It would appear as a buckyball/semi-geometric-cog being placed into a socket (designed and then operating within that would be the accelerations of the plasma-fields etc)-Like a collider around a WORLD CORE
Based on Xcodespace-Timespace in Flux of course---being comergent or shared (retroactive+spontaneity causualities)-achieves special-relativity in singularity (congruency lock-gates)--is primarily to lock and seal any potential hazard or dday 
Incorporates full quotient and polarized-usages (full transcommnication and teleportation within region) --Does well to achieve equilibrium through all power reserve and circuitry. (corrects multiplicity/conjecture and other Quantum Aux-issues)
*In maximum compact-capacity and fuel efficiency would be a square mile in size and height at least. Reducing Trafficing Cost from 10,000 to 1. Increasing Potential Travel Efficiency or power output in (Alot of Percents) Dyson Achieve Tokamatic-Supremacy (Maximum Capacity)
Achieves Delemetal Blume (if not yet already) and Circumvents REM strata. (Including Metro strata)- Can Bypass Various Stand Alone Modules and Solid States with Soveriegn Encode (Great Impunity)
Experiemental Orichalum Crystal Extract T8 Commodity and Food Additive (Full Replenish Full Nutritionally-Catered Timed-Release)

12/13/2023
Advanced Level Quarantine
Fully Realized Casing (outer region)
Dyson-Synapse-Central-Hub (Collider-Toroid)
Upgraded with a centrifuge (orichalum construct-casing)--full construct casing and compound-orchichalum dyson-marker
Complimentable with remote lair-wards and or sieged "integrated lair tensors" (multi-capital support) (Central Pallete "almost forgot to mention a new XNAV devpallete-already explained above" now with dyson carepackaging)
DistelleryWorks+Skunkworks=HiveWorks

TopLevel-Quarantine
Beta-ONLY EndGame-Character Upgrades for (May Require Reserve/Sustains or Upkeep to Maintain) -(this is what we were waiting for)
Version 2 of slueth/striker/stacker (party system of a medium,large,small) 1,2,3 whole system 
Dominant Rex-Enhanced-Exoform
Adapt to (Trascend/Reborn/Nuvolve Etc)-->Element(Padded)--Masked(tusked)--Hypnotic(SynthMod)--(better use of limit/mood) and equipped with Xcodec-Palletes (Better use of cracking/hijacking)
Can induce contingency (remote travel points) and (auxhole-navigation) without backup systems or relays necessary (because Xnav)
Also due to class-superiority a secondary overbearence and a secondary supporting build-(Agi/Dex/Str MainFocus/ Con/Int/Wis SubFocus)--can be inhibited and (work to insulate attack)--acting as a counter shield ---(basically has its own natural armor/magic armor built-in now) via (CHR/LUK based added-effect)
Exotic Decore - "Spikes/Quills/Horns/Claws/Scales/Patterns/Textures/Crests ETC all develop based on Ambience and Class/Builds" --Can be exchanged for a preferred Custom-Brand (Property Set)--is basically bio-engineering (Rebuild of a Custom Xcodon)--so thats just a test/experimental Condition of Evolved-xTypes
(and also why not a dark mode for dark-powers/ghosts/lanterns/lich/phantom based x-types as well)--or at least a special minion for them (Minions can perception check)--help with true-dodge/glancing/feinting/saving-throws (makes them more likely for you and less likely for opponents)--added protection from PRE-EMPTIVE/1st-Strikes
Also InWorld Conditions which may work as Bylaws/FactionRulesets that they can only use their "new talents" in Arena-Only or Private Settings --And Not Allowed to Do Much but Discuss in ONTOPIC-Forum/Board pertaining to their "Acquired Builds" under Official-Faction-TRUST and resulting Penalty if in Violation. :_) (not gonna argue why)
Here's why, because its a faction-moderated advancement and reserved for intial contracts that are under trusted-agreements (so YOUR OWN faction models or properties can't be basically stolen)---you're welcome.
There are other things but I know for a fact these are more likely (and are more backed by theory rather than nothing at all)
Also Minions can use fleet attacks if encharged--this means multi-minions/Swarms can be used alongside as wards too (auto-sentries)

Sleeper Level Quarantine
This next part involves End-Game Raiding and gets very hazardous to characters
The Upgraded Slueth/Strikers/Stackers also have counterparts in (Rivals Such as AI/Lair/Rex)--just to name a few (there are probably crimerings too or pirates)
(Xstrain):-Viral/Nerv/Toxic --(Node-Meta):Septic/Crypt/Corrupt --(ghost-script):Shock/Flash/Corrupt
These counter abilities are so bad. Infact, we know all of them but it is mostly for Physical/Digital/Paranormal
These things start out at 10th world but dont really attack until 11th world (They are so bad and honestly they scare me)

--The Best Strategy is: 
Construct Level Quarantine and Remote Command
A Titan Class Ship (with a fleet preferred and jump-rail too--as in arc's and colonies)--and their own Dreadnaughts (yes please) --both squads and fleets and titans all have dreadnaughts (these things are necessary)
This crap is so bad. It scared me and I am glad I have these ships. Hopefully they are automatic and produceable ASAP by now.
Use of an Active Patrol and Security Regional Sec (World Sec and System Sec)--to keep this from happening. Too late though it happened. and it's just like a very bad counter-op.
All of this "BS" actually happens alot. This is how to deal with it automatically now.
There are probably ways to handle it with VPN/Proxies and just every form of CPU Environment and Server Environment and CLINICALLY-STERILE-Server Farm and DataBase but you will eventually need to just evacuate if you don't have a full Army. Sorry.
Having a Faction Protecting you from this should be default (but sometimes it isn't) You might be good enough even with a simple 'Frigate' to outlive an incursion, who knows. I know, and I wouldn't feel comfortable with anything less than a battleship.
This Setup will help to survive Multiple Dday-Attacks. Well that will suck if even one goes off. It will be useful to at least handle a few of them.
Transfixed Compass (Integrated Mapping Compass with Mapping System)--may use nueral-grids as charters on mapping-profile and other charter profiles (ai-prompting charter for instance)--(ledger-charters)--(both those and workspace-related charter)--(modcharter)-(these charters together with a compass for a self-explorable charter base--on any level including dungeon level)
Allows "for bidding" contracts of charters (speaking of faction charter exchanges are forbidden)


******************************************************************************************
Charter Pallete
******************************************************************************************
12/14/2023
Charter Seeding Profiles which can be called on during progeneration/analysis comparison
Advanced Allocation "Profiles" safe and better distinction/distinguishing of warez/xcodes during analysis and better artifact recollection/memorialized handling/processing
Advanced Assorting "Profiles" that help with item/object classifications and help to sort/organize types by properties
Advanced Recognition "Profiles" Able to better 'recognize' item types such as the difference between a comparison card/mesh/node/bomb for isntance what the difference is between those or an advanced measure of an item property "corpse/chemical" : i.e. corpse-card/chemical-mesh and so on.
Advanced item-trees/stems "profiles" which mean compensated items or "very disguised items" can be built into and their profiles shared over other "pathways" via quick-call or etc between Seeds/Uuids

The profiles were getting xploited so there was a new xpad system to reduce this from occuring. The entire wpad usage has been upgraded to an xpad usage (which is an encrypted wpad)--most wpads are already encrpyted, this now encrypts it even further.
With a Wpad-->Xpad encryption using the Xnav capability and Xcodes that are now encrypted (as being normalized to regular encodes thru this process they can be assigned encryptions, even though xcodes are encrypted. So its not only doubly encrypted but doubly doubly so.)
So let me just say the timeline of this encryption and where it picks up from. The development of the dysonrelay/delemetael bouquets (back at the completion of the NuAirx Systems and SleeperMode)--picks up from there, goes over the bulkheads, goes over the biometric podspaces, and now the runway-DeepSim-Hiveworks etc. So it makes its own expanse in four parts.
Hopewfully this covers the marginal emplacemnts of all security efforts (the frameworks and where they begin and end over all the breakpoints involved)--and why its considered advanced and why there is a pallete for all of this now

Review (its backwards but it works okay this way)--(Devs Will only need to backtrack so far before situations based on severity/critical urgency etc)

Not sure if I should also add-on for an azone-adhoc-containment-cell
what inspired this is a clinically isolated environment
(and all the security effects of encryption) that owuld allow for an azoc after hiveworks(post-dyson-region)
So we can have it but does it really make it any better? Well that is debatble.
The best case is that there would be a pillar storage of empty-container-spaced-capsules/canisters or holding-stats or any thing that would need to retain its "Stand Alone" properties (as na isolated compartment or bulkhead)
I wanted it to be something anyway. The other thing is that of course we have a tier build of all modules and it takes its affairs and combative status with it. (Like a NoManSky-Base) imo but here's how ours works:

These can all be xpiloted(so thats fun)
1)We have the robotic-unit/goliath etc with its core-system (by now its a mini-collasus that acts as its own kernal) this is built into the frame and also has its appendages/armatures etc (and a functioning "headpiece" that would also likely lock into a socket for security.
2)This fits into a battle-deck or "field transport" we basically call it an xroller anyway (now it is carried if it must be)--this is a mobilehousing for it basically and all its add-ons (modules such as recharging etc)
3)that takes it to a larger vassel allowing for "flight" or a jetpack/tanking vassel
4)which goes to a sub for expeditionary (full excursionary)
5)sub goes to a fleet-dreadnaught
6)dreadnaught goes to a titan (acting module) or station/such as a dyson/loic
We more or less have this all built in minecraft by now (too bad I would have to rehash everything :P) I cant upload the level its like over 10 gigs worth of building it. So I will either rehash it all later or not. 

(I will just parse the regions over once I feel like it, protip I dont feel like it right now because it would take me a week--if only i had people do this for me) I do know that on my last computer the titan took 5 minutes or so to actually be loaded and rebuilt automatically.)
Maybe its only slightly faster now that I have a better setup. (Too bad that was a couple of years ago)--before I ended up writing it all down. (Information gets too much for me to keep to myself)
I am still working on the other half of EXTRAS WIP (actually its only like 15% filled up and I have been just awfully distracted lately)--Its going to involve alot of it all being a SIDE-OP for ice-mining (which I describe somewhat perfectly and make it all work and fit into place with everything 100%)

So we have all that in affair then let's say it needs to be isolated compeltely again but does not need to be rebuilt as a hiveworks (it can be "benched/set aside in an isolated pocket-space"
This is why the azoc is important and allows that to be accomadated for so long as its sustained (and usually is internally sustainable but also can be server-hosted) on server-aux-space (ipSEC) allowing porting
if the server were to shut down the podspace would exhaust its power supply and "dump the contents of the pocketspace" into where cache area that may occur (and would simply be an "abandoned node with such and such adequeacies"
So I am really happy to save the HiveWorks purpose would be this more or less.

The secure SAP-GateLOCK (XSUB-Purgatory)
Can house an aquifir as well.
This can be made alleviated with automated-kernal-based prosper-congruency (quantum handling of a kernal)
this can also encrypt the aquifir (container) for massive reprogramming of xcodes (youre welcome)
Handles the exo-lattice handled with the compass/pallete and hiveworks 

The transcript for the Nueral Networks and Xprofiles as well being handled over the XNAV-XPAD here allow it a remote-usage as a co-operative-protocol (self-induced module)-correction (and stat applier)--work efficiency and optimizer for calc/procs
This allows for more secure handling of depth-charged/auto-correct reactions of any commodoity/resource/meta/ambience (which is sort of a big deal spanning all of these bonuses and as to why the profiles were able to be "exploited" thru pallate counters" or something related to the encryptions HERE. Which should be fixed (double) now.
It checks for Memorial/marginal Issues (in orientations of character display) 1
Bipartisan Usages or Side-Bench Issues with Networking/Compatibility 2
5 Stage Counter Features examining all surface level issues and properties ranging from (1environment-->2wpad-->3xnav(which was the main issue as to its orientation on any of its levels and prior alignments being converted to free-access/domain)-->4PALLATECONTROLLER(which was nonexistant now is firmware to itself)--5Charter-PROFILES-FORBOTH DEV/CHARTER Conversions)
So now that should fix everything for REMOTE-USAGE within a RePROGRAMMED AQUIFIR/KERNAL STAND ALONE SOURCE-LOCK
Now it can Transcode for itself since it wasnt really able to before without having to rebuild the library for itself (ALSO this is called AUTONAV-MACROS just for safekeeping it should be defaulted)
Author's NOTE--(and oh my god please just reference this and see why THIS crap had to be redone FOR EVERYTING ON THIS PAGE (it should be color coded just because)

And I suppose the adhoc-azone with the SAP-Particle-Aquifir-Kernal will have a lensing (self-enclosure) that may use to print or at least one time terminate or execute itself with (for whatever reason in data/feedback/transmission/scripting
since the encode has already become xcode it will revert and conert from xcode to whatever preference on pallete.
this merges both green/orange (nuclear-working) tiers of encode/xcode into a transfixed (code)--which is usuable with enclosures in the way of a "crude/draft" basis simulated the full RGB-color screening via   (RAW G-O)(crude--draft)/(XCODE G-O)(crude-draft)/(Transfixed RAW(c:d)/XCODE(c:d) G-O)
The simulation is only really known as Green/ORANGE while Simulated different states of RGB which translate through the script using RAW/DRAFT issues of ENCODES/XCODES under NUCLEAR/Plasma accelerations and the whole thing is set to the RGB-CYM complexes that once accelerated can perform as a transcode of xcodes.
These transcodes may also be encrypted and may also have different layers of encryption meaning the whole encryption tier-based system will have to be MACRO'D for easy access over an API-extension-(InterConnected-Token if to be used with interactive-contracting)--SAP(contracting)
This is already laid out by default in the system but should also be expedited for the SAP-AZOC so that internalized-firmwares can interact with each others hardwiring (For ultimate-interactivity via ONBOARD-API-GENERATION) that "once registered" is considered connected and then made verified by exchange of SAP-DATA
This is the same as Blackboxing the AIBUCKET but for A SAPMODULE-that is used for Modifications of the SAP-environment which simply allows for a compability with its own system hosts (To Interact with its own AI-BUCKET)
