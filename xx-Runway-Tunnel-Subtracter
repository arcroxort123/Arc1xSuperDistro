The Full Dyson Construct (ExoNav)
XX-Runway-Tunnel-Subtracter --- Making Platform Abstraction from a Dyson Mega-Cube--(HyperCubic VR Projection) to (A Full Simulation)--Using an Augment-Data-Reactor
Support and Congruent Quantum DownFlow (Exchange Networking) (mmmmmmmkkkkkkkkkay) to combining them as a Dyson-Turbine (Yeah probably not happening but Quantum Teleportation)
*(also um its sort of a railroad for spies that are hostage)

We have developed a complicated dyson simulation system (with hosted simulation space)
Now we are going to extend the capabilities of that system to a "better prompt" and stylizer that works as an all in one formatting for custom contracts (request or submissions)

Part 1 Dyson-Vrx-Platform (Upgrading the Legacy: Rail and Prosper and Region) + (NuAIRx) to the Dyson-Vrx-Engine Etc) as "Nu-Region"
Dyson Rail:(A)
Shortcut "Tunnel"/Runway System
Partition Space Dedicated for Fast Tracking File-Generation (Incorporated to a Dyson Pod-Share Brief Simulation)
Works as a Remote-Live-Mail Fetch and Bulletin System (Quest Timer)
Acts as a Farewell-Negotiation (To a BonVoyage)/HelloWorld --FairwayLaunchProtocol of DeepSim/Xsynch with Xcode-Ejection
Full Emissionary Detailer - Ricochet-Rebound xSplasher (Buffering Service)

Dyson Prosper "WorkPoint":(B)
Applies a Nu-Assortment Code Inject (Hyper-Railed)/Accelerated
Runs off main rail assortment to meta-prosper-assortment (joint operative)

Performs Class Priority Data Sweep (Specialized Preset/Macro Allocation)
Class-Template Prioritization to Class Template Prioritization --Reverse-Compatibility of hardwire Version (Specialized Firmware-Subtract)-Applicator
(Low Impact - Full Dive / Fulton / LiftOff) Multi-Selection and Preferential Profiling (Specialized Search Indexing)

Part 2 (Applying A Reactor Augment // Acting as Extension to a Working Dyson-Platform) -- (Dyson Server Casing and Header for Deep Sim Data Exchange "Dyson Runtime Network")
Dyson Component Region-Locker (similar to f-layer on region built for dyson):(C)
Model-Suggestive Preset and Itemization of Request/Contract (Inventorial Negotiation) - Imperitive CheckSystem
Dyson-Augmented-Reactor (Very nice) + System Life-Support + (System Directory Organizer and Firmware Compatibility List)
Works in Tandem with (A)(B) and StandAlone as (C)--best to have all cylinders.

Part 3 (Part1+Part2)
Real Time Exchange Service of Contract-Custom-Dyson-Sim "World Seed" Aggregate-Access

Almost Forgot to put this into the document of Part 3
Is better to have a dedicated Reactor handle this Extension or at least a Main-Central-Nexus
Optional Easy Case-Extension-Adapter for Tap/Vpn and Interception-Via-DataDistellation (5th Chain Data Model) --Can be Turned Off/On (Works with Data-Inteceptor and Network-Stackable)
--"Dilutes Data into Packet Chunks for Reassembly after Quantum Teleportation" and Recompiles based on Build-Protocols Of Site-Transcode (Based on Credential Api-Secure Usage) --or something.
Translates 3rd Party or Affiliate/Partnered Trusted Information into a Clear-Access-Framework (which then acts as Central HUD)--for all information transfer (informative filters or protocol-operandi)
With Bypass Strict to Pipeline Priority (Preferential Data-Feed) Uses Lots of CPU+RAM (OVERCLOCKED or TURBO) it uses most and more than all usually VirtualRAM and Availible Ram (Full OVERHAUL) which should be mitigated by Network Dataflow-Limits (Pref-Buffering)
Similar to SD-Options (And Attention Preferences to DataLoads) --Can cause system hangs (Usually Choppy Stream But can be fixed if dedicated and "untampered" connection is mostly streamlined for this particular process 
(server-distrubted data-feeding)--think of it like tightening suspensions until they are more or less over-loaded and pop off but allows to cheat weight limits. It can be throttled to avoid detection (which will sometimes autokick a connection
therefore connections must be also -reconnected)--once it clears up it can be "auto adjusted" under known stressors (within acceptence or exemption) --it will then still maybe cause a system hang or (fast rejection due to exception being recognized)--if this occurs it can be default to normal speeds
That is why its optional (it isnt necessary to have this extension to utilize aggregate-access)--it just helps if the system is allowed to over-ride "third party limitations" by supplementing its own capability. (Other systems might not allow this due to permissions or securityissues)--IDK 
(It would take even more hacking to see if it would work afterwards anyways)--It doesnt always work because "obselete tech" or incompatibility or just plain "unable to compensate for this "extrenuated stress on a dataload"
It should actually be called SERVER-HUSTLING --imo that describes the kind of situation taking place.
---
We have an expected packet, we want to have it instantly, we want the packet to be as large as possible to reduce the request and speed things up---naturally other technology will not be able to take this into account and "desynch" or trigger a flag or something.
Unless it can then it will be instantly siphoned as much as possible per the request issued. See what I am saying? Oh well. It would basically "transport entire fleets worth of information at a time or basically a full space colony to instanteously be teleported if for instance, a world-ending situation occured or system freeze :P"
"Even my own computer can't do this "atleast 10% of the time anyway" 90% of the time it crashes on a game load while running this entire thing (Comparitively this entire thing I can run on my computer, plus just this little part here can crash my computer)
so of course I would reccomend an actual server setup for this (I run my poor computer like a server would be run lol i.e. Don't do that!)
So a server should be good enough for doing this.

Now we get to count back all the times we would have used the "data distellery". So of course we would use it here at the very end.
We would use also at the start of the interceptor development (if we had even known about it--protip:we did)
because we wanted to use it way way back during legacy--sometime during the extras-development (still writing that out right now)
So we know there are those three parts we can use it with. Somewhere In Legacy/Extras/and with the RUNWAY / + "and all the little places any time there would be data used anywhere"--which is EVERYWHERE ELSE.
Using the distellery with THE ENTIRE SYSTEM--+using it with an interceptor WILL DEFINITELY require a fully dedicated nexus (for which THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT)--by the time we use it at all, we should be working towards finalizing the DYSON-REACTOR + DYSON PLATFORM (which it can be used with either)
Using it with the full system and the ENTIRITY of all its version is where it will work out best!
----So now we prioritize it by parses that it will handle (SPECIFIC parses or all of the ones possible)--this will cover hundreds of layers of server-hosted-processing over several trays/stacks. So now we can just use it all over "1U RACK" for instance and that should cover everything mentioned more or less. I assume anyway.
I PERSONALLY DONT OWN A SERVER OR A RACK FOR IT BUT IF I HAD ONE I WOULD BE GLAD TO INCORPORATE THIS SOMEHOW TO IT. hint hint wink wink nudge nudge.

Now we are taking alot of data from our own data milling and all our parses on every layer we can and mixing it into a commodified data-chunk (for DEEP-SIM immersion/projection) I don't know what to say. We can call it a NuDyson/Nuvolver-Tray because it will be hosting at least one LOADOUT of the "METACHUNK" it makes. (Actually several, infact they will all make a server/shard for a cluster if not enough by themselves)
And that would require alot of data-distrubtion which we have pipelined for express-exchange and secured it over the Data registery / DATABANK of all the account/contracts that it can be used  to host someone's game (like a minecraft host) if they wanted (A DEEP SIM HOSTING SERVIVCE)--that's where the moolah would be anyway. (And its kinda a big deal if infact they were streaming out that entire "relm/shard" it would need its policy-coverage.
If you absolutely have to provide a launcher for the bare necessities or minimum experience for (aggregate-access via a server host)--that would they allow them to interact as "A CUSTOMER WOULD EXPECT THEIR EXPEIRENCE TO BE IN ALL GENUINE REGARD TO THE SERVICE PROVIDED AS ADVERTISED"
IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO make an OFFER-PAGE for them to order it by.

AND JUST SO HAPPENS --we already would have designed a POLICY with the CONTRACT/ACCOUNT anyway and just section out exactly what that entails for "Hosting a Product/Server Chain" for instance so they could play a GAME/COLLAB/REMOTE-CONNECT at all. (Think like an E-ARENA)--and it would be acceptable under contract permissions and rates. (For which they likely have providied the costs for)--being that of which was assigned by their party-membership ETC. (Let's rank it like Standard/Deluxe Silver/Gold/Plat ETC) That kind of thing.
And then the server would dedicate the processing availibility of that (for instance if in a server farm)--would dedicate a server tray/rack to allot for the usage expected of the "event"/"contract"
Pretty Easy to Understand Nothing Complicated about that. It does not need to be any more complicated than that on the business 
I am saying, oh you will need such and such percentage of an availiable server, here you go//it costs this much, type sort of agreement. Would be the situation there (with policy and regional regulations that apply of course)
I feel like the system I am describing works, for those that have a server to use it they would apply my theories in this way (And it would be a nice way about it)------------unlike some -other unnamed services out there---my way of doing it would be fair as I have already shown this lays out like.


SO LET ME GET BACK TO THE DISTELLERY PARSE AVAILIBILITY WOULD BE EASIER DESCRIBED IN SUCH A WAY ON AN OFFER PAGE
To OFFER SERVICES BY PARSE OR TYPE.
That would likely involve the generic layout of the rail/prosper/region/platform etc all of that. Breaks down into a menu of sorts.
It is more recomennded to SELL BY WORLD-EDITION than anything. OR BY A 1U SERVER RACK for the WHOLE OF EVERYTHING
GOOD LUCK WITH THESE OFFERS ANYWAYS:

Sorted by Tier and major sectors and World Edition: 
For the Rail: (60 or so)
(Note the first 40 are the entire Nexus-barebones Setup and should be its own OFFER for start-ups)
(The full rail is 60 or so and should also be its own offer for better jumpstart)

For the Prosper:(45 or so)
(The first 15 or so are for Basic-Automated-Launch Site Development and Colonization)
(The Second 15 or so are for Genetic Lab Biome Production and Travel)
These can both be in their own package or together. (For Advanced Colonization)
(The Last 15 or so are strictly Data-Trafficing and also require large amounts of battery/power sourcing if not sustained by a reactor)

--*(Are we still "screaming internally? dramaticpause-It Would appear so Yes")

Service Announcements (Openings or Allotments):
Taking a Step back. We can see the potential to Utilize this program to replicate other programs.
Taking a file-type, breaking it down to parameters, and emulating a workflow (seems like a simple transcode)--which can be replicated on a surface level.

Contract Order/Pre-Production:
We can take a file--and integrate prompt into the selection, to REVERSE-Engineer or Re-Design its Resulting Product.
We can simulate settings/selections/preferences/programming through transcripting the file-types at a surface level (designating parameters and establishing a mock-up of its workflow)
IT help to ARLEADY be able to transcode the file directly, and using known file-types the "deductive processes can be alleviated or assisted".

Procedure/Methods:
For instance we want to change a movie to include certain properties of a prompt-given-request. "I want this movie to be more Cartoon-like or its Characters to be different based on my own Profiles of "Cartoon Characters"
For instance I want to "Remaster the Movie to be designed as a "Matrix-Like Post-Apocalypse" or include "A Noire-Setting BackDrop" throughout selected scenes. (This would take some Effort, but can be done)
We would expedite this process in a variety of ways, and the user could select via a Test-Sample or Template of "Easy-Access-Modulations"
So there we go.
What I mean by "a variety of ways"--is that either it would snapshot the instance or given frame-by-frame and re-engineer it based on prompt and post-renditions at a "Surface Level" or it would Intensively Emulate certain Transcripts which it would detect or have primed for application.
This would be called LIQUIFIX/INTENSIVE LIQUIFIX. (Surface to Encode Level Transcripting)

The Manufacture Process:
Injection of XCode Likely Occurs Here:(PREP)
We would attempt a "Liquifix" transcode --See what works, See what methods can be used in combination and apply them based off User-Prompted/Preferential Scheduling.
The next stage (apparently there is a next stage)--would be to use that as a template for further Liquifixing.
Using these "novel methods" we can generate a Emulation of a workflow (in either way if it works to the desires of the user than GOOD)--the user could attempt to "enhance" results through a resolved "CHROSS-SYNCH" of their Workflow with other Workflows (or provided original workflow with "the redesigned workflow")
(A)Liquifix and (B)Chross-Synching (Would then work together after-images all auto-adjusted templates and parameters (OMG just....w/e) and replicate a new product.
Make Cartoon Movie Like "the Matrix" with "Noir Settings" and use "new Cast members based off this list" <--/A/<-->/B/--> with such and such other properties (Subtitles or Different Resolutions and other Impromptu Editing Choices)
Injection of XCode Likely Occurs Here:(DRAFT)
Prefaced for Deep SIm Use--Would Involve an Easy-Case Sampling (and so on) given or generated of a Base-Model/File-Type/WorkFlow. (In which to incur upon a World Seed or End-Product for Dyson-Construct Usage)---(OK)-(Express-Adaptive-Dyson-Profile)-EPG-EADP-(Reserve-Power-Depletions)-Turbine-PreReqs/Check
