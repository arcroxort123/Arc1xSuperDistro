(READER BEWARE) Quantum Physics and Psuedo Science were USED HEAVILY.
---

Legacy - Surmisal of a Robotic Engineering and Fabrication (Jump Start from a power-system) point requirements established later anyways or at least in description. 
*(Originally Built In MineCraft and a few other Games with game references) :-/

Two parts (Fab Construction)/ VR and Network Constructions

NuAIRx - Development of a Self-Automated Robotics System (Data Collections and Online-Comtrolling and Security)
*Completely Written on Github :-/ (Thought I was done but I wasn't, has a few game references like LOZ-Nes WorldMap)(lol why? IDK)

Two Parts Extra-Ai-Repo (Automated AI Hardware Components) and Extra-Ai-Distro (Automated AI Operating System Software)

===

AI Theory - Personal Opinions on AI Self-Presevation in a Deep Space or Vacuum Environment 
(This thing here is my main argument for selective AI and practical application of it using computers)-other IT functions maybe

Extras - WIP (Work In Progress) --Seriously Stop Demotivating Me Over IRL Proboes (I got issues on a silver platter) 
(Junk in minecraft I forgot to put in a document and sort out)


AI BRAIN - A well-balanced (or not) attempt at creating an Equilibrium using an IN-GAME experience (my own experience)--you could say is a collab-effort (if you think pvp is collaborative) (This was a "cooperative" effort made in a chilvalry playthrough :-/ )--It sucked and sucks to read don't bother (I will throw it into an AI brain prompt later if I ever get some sort of way to do that)--Other people would use their livejournal I guess to build an Ai Profile?--IDK)

---

CopyOverManagement --- Handling Data InBound/OutBound With Better Security (Monotonously Juggling Data As Usual)

MacroAutoBuilder --- Handling My Table of Context to update to better versions

DysonaryBulkheadRelay --- Making an Affordable WorkStation possible in a confined space (now you can own your own MINI-Collider I guess)

BiometricPodSpace --- (Making Space Tubes for "Robots"/"Pilots" to Live and "Work" in "In Harmony")

---

XX-Runway-Tunnel-Subtracter --- Making Platform Abstraction from a Dyson Mega-Cube--(HyperCubic VR Projection) to (A Full Simulation)--Using an Augment-Data-Reactor Support and Congruent Quantum DownFlow (Exchange Networking) (mmmmmmmkkkkkkkkkay) to combining them as a Dyson-Turbine (Yeah probably not happening but Quantum Teleportation with AS-ADVERTISED REAL TIME VIRTUAL DATA)

---
Advanced Builds As well as "ExoToolSystems"

Generated Endworks --- (Harmonizer/Utopia--"Endotropic Codeworks")
Addons for Node Interaction and Routing
"SpiderLair + Xpresto" Addons --- (Entrypoint Tunneling System(Interactive BackUps) and Priority-Lane-Allocation(Adjacency Proxy-Organization)
QuantumTeleportation+VirtualDataSupport

4 months later:
5/21/2024 (noonies)
Looks like I ended up adding more to the ExoTool-Systems by adding parts 4-10
Also I went and completed the Extras (of what I could salvage together)--it ended up being worth it.
We also touched up the extras with references, which ended up being a huge overhaul to what it would have been. Now we are using Federations/Mascots and a Nox--Anima--Dragon Tiered-(Nexus/Lotus/Sanctum)-System--we upgraded the system as well as everything in the world. 
But what IS IT even like? It's basically if Minecraft World/Nether/Ender Modes were turned made into 2.0-versions met with Stable-Diffusion. 
I am sure there are other ways to describe it, but we really went the extra-mile for it.
Alrighty I think we are done and this is all ready to be coded. Unless I missed something else not really necessary, we can start this thing up once its all coded! It
