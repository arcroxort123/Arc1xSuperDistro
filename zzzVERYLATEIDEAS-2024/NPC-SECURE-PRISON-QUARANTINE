There are 4 omitted of prison/camp for npcs/workprograms which were intended for criminal/rogue insurgencies to be put to use but I am not sure I want to include them even though imo they are good building design. I just might as a joke maybe include them for game-space usage. As a joke.
The idea is that it would create some sort of flagship which it did create a defensive turret tower system and module, not that it was necessary, but it can be incorporated to the ai module builds now. So that's worth it, and its really simple. It also helps to prevent corruption from twisty-artifacts and purge monster attacks/spawns.
