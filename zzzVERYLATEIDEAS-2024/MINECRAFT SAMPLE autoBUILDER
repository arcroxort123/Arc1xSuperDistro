I have reviewed my documentation up to date, and wanted to mention that I would revisist it in the premise of creating a minecraft-player-bot.
This player-bot would host a variety of models in which to conduct and perform exercises in minecraft, such as building and crafting. Here is how I would outline its expected performance (but this remains to be tested): (by the way I have seen videos of ai minecraft and model usage comparisons, ideally this would work with my system)

So to that effect the first process would apply as:
Player-Spawn, Player Gather Resources/ Player MAP-space
This gets even easier with PLAYER-WRITE-JOURNAL and it will use journal snippets. (This requires alot of journaling)

With Conditions of any mapping of assessment being:
Is Space Occupied? Is space Non-occupied? Is space blockaded? Is space potentially blocked or occupied or non occupied? Is space in range of occupation.
