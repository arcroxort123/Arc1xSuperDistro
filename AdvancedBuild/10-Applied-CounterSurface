This is typical of how I would deduce a computation. This is a simple situation at first in which grubworks occur.
THIS MIGHT BE MISINFORMATION BUT I CAN MAKE IT WORK, AND I AM A DUMBASS, so uh, take that as you will.
LETS GET READY TO BOOF SOME ASS-CODE 
its for counter-surfaces so i can SAY WHATEVA I WANT

Applied-CounterSurface Part1
We have our initial signal which is killed off like a beep.
We have a second signal sequence which lasts longer slightly.
We have our third signal sequence which helps to switch from a bit of the initial to a secondary position of the beep-boop (boot sign). (which recognizes a space for which a beep could occur and skips over it, forming an unwritten or unmentioned-switched)--or just as well(it does the switch then and then because of its signal basis)
--
We permute these and abstract these to big/medium/small signals in which beep big/small/medium and big/small/medium boop  translate to various switches, and kills, of their pending beeps and boops in sequences.
6 or so total. We call it the abc and 123's of grubworks. Idk...i do anyway.
Because of this bs, we can keep a signal going when it otherwise would be killed.

We do this a bunch more with what works, what doesnt, what does work when it doesnt, what doesnt work when it does, etc. Whats working when it doesnt and making it look like its working or not etc when it isnt or is etc.
This is the typical killswitch signal mainframe to help to establish layers of signals within sequence of themselves and define a code-length. The codelength makes it so it can be used to define when and how or for how much space something is.
We use this code-length to establish a network of code-signals relative to themselves and form a code table. 1 is a single length/2 is a double length/ 3 a triple length/ 4 a quadrapel length (totaling at least 10 lengths for a table maybe more or less so depending on descripancy)--its basically a byte-template.

With the code table we form a basic fstab, knowing that it is the right way we want, we call it the fstab in which we simulate the grubworks in a code-length signaled as a partition of space.
With fstab one we have essentially defined grubworks under a signal itself and code length corresponding, we know that the fstab is there
We continue this technique of killswitch signal mainframes to establish layers of fstabs and build a dev1. (and the system is more or less able to retain its code-length and assigned grubworks as various fstabs under the assigned spaces and partition)
(The Fstab is a sequence of beeps and boops we know work, we then REVISIT ones that don't and fix them using the ones we know that work and make those more or less work, despite being a little more dirtier and rename them to dirty-signals)--we later clean these up but not now, we don't have the tools to do that per sae (unless we are skipping way ahead into G/Hboot remakes)

Such that we have made sequences of fstabs, we will call these DEV-spaces. The generic sequence for the first DevSpace is 1-FSTAB-Sequence. (The following are used for multiple sequences to definte ABC's and 123's and symbols AlphaNumerics by VALUE by also GUESSING the space required for them so it helps to leave out/ADD IN some room marginal errors)
With the input for DEV1 we apply, and create Dev2, which is based off the first dev1 and having been signaled to be apart from dev1 on its own space, we can also define Dev3 under the code table of dev1's fstabs and dev2's fstabs as the Dev3's fstabs for which represent the system table having been defined/alloted specific fstab-spacing in its partitions.
Now with those system tables in play we can begin the killswitch signal mainframes for those layers of dev-spaces with their assigned corresponding fstabs generating a system-table, a keymap of system-table variants, and an applied header for each system-table-variant expressed in keymaps and assigned code-lengths in the partition of that devspace (being finalized in dev3)
We finish out with the system table being marked as ext4 having assigned the keymap and codelength for that to occur as, and in that partition we replicate as a backup for in its usage (just because i dont want to go through it again when it gets corrupt) and another for using the backup within having already been built with some added codespace as is sensible to it being the FINAL-system-partition (of which is additive)

It's actually not ext4 but some other weird thing that might as well be that...sources just trust me bro (i dunno what to call it but its something)---UNFORTUNATELY, we have to convert this CRAP as it leaves alot of descripancy in the code-lengths of their assigned mappings, but generally its a good start to go with. We can't really fix it now so we can ignore it (we can live happily onward ignoring this forever but we shouldn't)
So fun...doing this all the time (i've done it at least 3 times and once even blind)
Now because of the Dev-Partitions we can begin to auto-build those into the correct system-assigned-codespaces being marked as G:/

G:/ actually means G1:/. So G2:/ and G3:/ following in the same killswitch-signal-mainframes and layers, being that g1 consists of the devspace builds, g2 consists of those builds under backup, and g3 consists of the backup with extra spaces.
And furthermore G1 defines the situation being, that since G2 backsup as G1, that follows that G3 is either case and whatever else it wants to be as, or how it wants that information as, and or how that information is when called on, and or how that it looks like when it is used, and how it translated in its use as being, whatever G3 wants that information to be used in the way it is. As to also relay it to others.
This is pretty much the automatic bios for which is set by those headers being built in grubworks. It is abstracted and corrected as well as switched correctedly by the code-tables, and further stablized with the correct fstabs and represented partitions that follow, as the DEV-space is applied (a single devspace can be used for this, but its better to have as much space to pack up it all in a single BIOS)-which can be automatic once its all built to the correct output of a signal and code-length (for which it should be by now)--however that was not easy without the key-maps and headers applied to represent them all with dev2 and dev3.

Now we are at H.
H is freely able to host G and continue interactive processes in which H acts as G, because H has as much space as it wants and is essentially the Hard-Drive. And because of this, we have reached a FULLQUARTER(25 steps) in which this can be safely adjusted if that INTIALIZED-encode/machine-signal/data-space is retained.  (From a savestate, continued-use, or assigned-ram/flash)--all of which the H-series can do)--infact:
INFACT, h can be used as a periphereal to G-being used, and can also later be used as an H-boot such as a flash over of G from a periphereal under the correct assigned-partition builds such as ext4 or btfs or uefi. Infact, this is where we take the H-BOOTs to be used as a Bios and Corresponding Terminal usage to define a ROOT INSTANCE. 
Root Instance is -I (or h2 if you follow)--this is good but it gets better:
and because root instance is not necessarily safe from boot-corruptions, it can be bypassed into USER-J (which is H3) (And now its great!)

The Great Gets even better:
--it later follows that the sequence is actually H0-h1-h2-h3 when using cryptographic implementation. H0 can be referred to as K (which is simple as cryptographically converted USER J) by logging in as USER J under a password. There are better cryptographic systems than just a password which will later be rebuilt into. However, getting the correct format and boot sequence to do so first is important by H1.
Performing the CRYPTOGRAHIC event the sequence becomes H1-H2-H3-H0 with H0 being USER J in cryptographic conversion, and essentially being the K STEP.
This KSTEP symbolizes the Quarter(25) being cryptographically applied. Making up for the next 20 steps in that things get complicated but breakdown as lmnop-qrstu-vwxyz (the next quarter)--im calling it a quarter because the steps get implied-more-heavily and valuate as more than usual as you might see.

it may also be that with vrsims: the quarter can translate a rollback/cryptographic cover of

The new-QUARTEr-sequence
This sequence was originally dialed back from A-B being filtered to others or themselves, but because ALSO USER-J gets BUMPED into a NEW-USER-STATE the whole sequences changes one-step over itself (so instead of J->U, J->V)--and why? Because I said it should)
The sequence was basically  based off a 15:25 ratio (A->whatever-assigned thing it would be)
Then it was based off 0->1 and some offset starter to 15:25 likely starting at K -> A
then it is cryptographic of (0->1)+1 15:21 a ratio that is slightly different but more or less same-count of things:(so its more like a starter of (1->2) where then +1 Starts with L->A
then it got complicated by making A B seperate from that and J -> U and L -> C or some crap.
then It got worked into for whatever reason the way it is now. (WHICH MAKES ME WANT TO KMS. So it must be true!)--but also it looks like it works so I am not going to complain.

floppy -> a (G-series)(FLASH1)
backup -> b (H-series)(crypto)
======
o -> c (ai-drive)(integrated ai-shell)(FLASH2)
p -> d (ai-disk stream)(intergrated ai-workspace)
======
q -> e (ai-disk writer)/shared-user(crypto)/locked
r -> f (shared-writers)/remote-user(crypto)
s -> g (simulated-disk)/ai-rewrites(crypto)
t -> h (simulated-shared-ai-writers(crypto)/unlocked
======
u -> i(ai-network)(FLASH3)
v -> j(ai-user)/new-user-crypto
w -> k(fuel based)/(charge based)(FLASH4)
x -> l(missing-package/package-filler)(autobuilder)
y -> m(new-ai-workspace)(crypto-currency based)/exclusive-user-access(ai-memetic-based)
z -> n(ai-thread potency availbility)

IF YOU DONT LIKE THIS SEQUENCE AND WANT IT TO BE A DIFFERENT WAY, just keep in MIND the other sequences I tried and failed out, but essentially it would look TERRIBLE, and maybe still work, if you wanted it that way (you would possibly go insane though because of how terrible it would be to keep track of, IMO)
By now we have fixed and adjusted certain appropriated partitions to be assigned for specific tasks and can later fix and render down the descripancy of their code-signal formatting for a better digitalized-streamline error free signal of data-based memetic code system. Which is incredibly dope to do with AI-integration because I dont have to uh...give two shits.
From HERE, we can just morse our way into any language system including binary and hexadecimal or further create cryptograph BASED-signal numerical-indexing which requires a true-formating or rewrited code-legnths-to-specified-formats anyways.
sources:just trust me bro (almost forgot this crap and there are reasons why)--its complicated and almost stupid. but it works.


ALRIGHT 
Applied CounterSurface Part 2
As above I had described a working or nomimal stable/unstable or otherwise erratic/normal system to some degree FUNCTIONS as intended. Now let me re-explain that in a different way.
In the course of a signal, a short or instant signal can be interpreted, as an instance for which may as well define a consecutive orientation of any account, generally in line of what is NEXT (from nothing). Such that the next thing is in order generally, whatever it is, will be, intepreted as that next thing being whatever it is, even if another signal, the very same. However it is for standard purposing, interpreted that same signals are the same all the time. This can be disputed but for the record of a system as above described, it will be kept as such.
Such THAT, a different signal such as a longer/potent signal may be applied, and intepreted as the other type there of. And is typical of MORSE CODE.
The orientation of that longer signal, might be expresed as yet, a different direction, as maybe the first being right, the longer version being left. Or a mixture of directions for who knows why by sequencing preferences or interpretations, regardless, this falls in line with the same description, that a signal is the way it is in some way, in other ways, maybe not so much.
Such that in a certain or degreeable expectation or timeframe a mixed signal or mixture or combined signal may apply different values/meanings in orientation, and that refers to ABSTRACTIONS being applied and FORMULATED AbSTRACTIONS being applied to CHANGE the original format of a signal for what is expected, to something different based on its combined-resolutions being configured as such.
That a Short signal (S) or long signal (L) might mean there own things in terms of left/right front/back on/off whatever, can be redeveloped into different meaning if applied in terms of SL or LS meaning an abstraction of S or L depending on priorities, and even LL and SS having meanings assigned to their abstractions of (something this/something that) now being (something else aftwards, even maybe something beforehand) depending on how complex you want it to be making SLS LSL their own thingamjig or also "inherent library"
This is basically how the first few paragraphs of PART 1 were conveyed, without abstraction in mind. NOW it can be in mind, it can be with cryptographics making it entirely different, or formatting making it mean something because the system itself inteprets it however it wants or is assigned to read it as. THE FACT IS, while the MACHINE-CODE IS THERE, it isn't always synonymous, even if its the EXACT SAME SIGNAL CONVEYING SOMETHING ELSE.
So THE MACHINE CODE needs to be defined, and for that, there are tools but also that ABSTRACTION of those codes, formulate differently under those definitions, and are up to intepretation. SOMEONE can technicalyl recode the entire WINDOWS-OPERATING-SYSTEM-MACHINE-CODE to effectively be something else entirely, maybe even, a fucking way to open up a hell-portal. TBH...that was already postulated with MICROSOFTWORD BEING A DOOM GAME SIMULATOR and having its own CODE built in to DOOM or some shit. Point remains.
The LIBRARY assignment needs to be perfectly clear, what is going to happen to the MACHINE CODE being interpreted as signals are conveyed, and how that represents to potential viral data or complicated UNEXPECTED-ERRORS and RUNTIME-ISSUES that crash the system, were it otherwise interpreted differently for instance to be a massive KILL COMMAND to critical processes. DISSECTING the ABSTRACTIONS is the FIRST STEP to knowing how certain signals will react under their MACHINE CODE-PHYSX/EXPIRY. 
And in fact, some SAFE REMOVAL of other devices may result in complications of other DEVICES having recieved inteference of their ENCODES being tampered with, even if not directly. This however is generally avoided by each program having their own data-base and libraries assigned by their own PROGRAM FILES etc which operate throughout the OFFICIAL SYSTEM LANGUAGE-SET. This can also be a REGIONAL-LANGUAGE PROBLEM but can also be STREAMLINED to a corrective fix and generally fast-application of slap fixing and patches under corrective settings to prevent a re-occuring problem. Because security knows best I guess.
This is a VERY MISNOMERED LATENT EFFECT of using MACHINE CODE and ELECTRICAL SIGNALS but it quickly BECOMES OBSOLETE AND FORGOTTEN With very few instances where an outbreak of this problem persists, and sometimes it can be devastating to A FILE-TABLE/FORMATTING which is dependent on these baseline signal types, but is GENERALLY FILTERED THROUGH BASIC ABSTRACTION AND LANGUAGE-COMPATIBILITY ETC.
THIS ALSO CAN BE LATER OPTIMIZE TO NEVER EVER BE A PROBLEM, but not always in the EARLY STAGES OF A BASIC OS MACHINE CODE DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE, it can be exploited and DRASTICALLY. Infact, people have done this before this exact thing in hacking, but I simply do not care to get into that aspect right now. I am TRYING TO CORREALATE A SUBSTITUTE EXPLAINATION OF WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY DEMONSTRATED.
---
In that SUCH case of EXAMPLING/I dont have an exmaple SORRY. But if you FOLLOW THAT LINE OF CODE you can begin to MANIPULATE ABSTRACTING A COMMAND LINE INTERACTIVELY, but knowing WHEN TO "knock around" and when not to "knock around" signals to achieve a different definition than intended in order to CONTRIVE some WORKABILITY where otherwise there may be none, this requires alot of trial and error but gets done once it "Hits the NOG" as they say. (obivously im bored and making up sayings)
Here we can assembly some DEGREE of actual linguistics, that may be SUFFIX/PREFIX to yet another signal, and we can see and abstract a complicated manner of (left and rights) etc into being something like prefix/mainword/suffix in which the MAINWORD is HEAVILY influenced and often changed of its resolved/resulting outcomes or even HEAVILY MIXED with other words for which may be synonymous. LSLS-SLSL-LSSL might actually be the same as SLSL-SSLL-LSLL but i didnt do the MATH or have a decent library to make it so. 
(let me make a veryfucked up and crude number joke that could 666=777 or some shit like that)--heh, doom portals are NOT TOYS, ANYWAYS, we essentially are working with a LOWBROW-midgrade-HELLPORTAL that is code-linguistics. And As with synonymous as that may be in different terms, might mean COMPLETELY differently ADVERBLY. It's really just a chance situation, and I really couldn't give a flying neener-neener.
But let's assume we built some form of HBOOT or even a BOOSTRAP prefaced programming such as a bios/diagnostic/installer/code-format such as what I would refer to as a MSFT (or micro-signal-formatted-template)---or some shit, i forgot what I was thinking because i was in a brain-fog. BUT ANYWAYS, Something like that could basically set up a quick FSTAB-situation and make for a virtualized-computation being quickly advanced (less reliably and more of a just trust me dawg type of code-work)
And that new interpretation of signalling, might work in countersurfaces, or might not work in surfaces, so is somewhat SPECIAL case and may depend also on outliers such as interpretations and detection agency's with other systems to pick up being, that you might just intialize an ACCIDENTAL-DATAWIPE by inherent-mis-directed-CODEworks being interpreted as "potentially hazardous/dangerous encodes" that otherwise in any other circumstances MEAN---bad news for your build and all of your saved works, hence why SECURITY is neccesary, but in early stages "WE SIMPLY DONT HAVE MEANS TO ESTABLISH GOOD SECURITY PROTOCOLS EXCEPT THROUGH KNOWN RELIABLE PRACTICES"--for which are almost entirely faithbased that nothing goes wrong anyway.

When you break the risk down in terms of particle physics, either the state of the particle REGISTERS or not, and simply, that could also entail fluctuations in a particle environment and yield FALSE-MEASURES and things that won't work otherwise, without that chaos or stablility in the choices and requisitites made effort of composing. SO, also, in some CASEWORKS, the stipulation is that "some danger may be required, or not preferred" depending on calculations of MACHINE CODE necessary ot otherwise the measures needed to be taken in order to make the CODE-WORK-AT-ALL.
SO NOW, we have this philosophical dillema, in which the preferences of doing things ONE WAY versus the OTHER may infact impose some degree of RISK of UNCERTAINTY of QUALITY or that it may be HAZARDED to not be a "VIABLE or SAFE" OPTION and should be used in LIEU of or in TERMS of a SEPERATE-TASK/VARIABLE-TASK for which is more APPROPRIATED for that CIRCUMSTANCED or "OTHER REASONS for which are not altogether CLEAR".
THIS SHOWS UP WITH SECURITY and is more IMPERATIVE on SECURE-MATTERS, such as there now being evidences for the need of SAFEMODES and SECUREBOOTS and RAIDPROFILES and things like that.
It is a SECURITY ISSUE to arrive or depart an encode-signal as intepreted to an IMPERATIVE, and by the way, lots of OVERSIGHT occurs in which sometimes, a given encode is SIMPLY NOT SECURE, or needs EXPRESSED CLEARENCES and AUTHORIZATIONS before ADMITTING to, and where was I going with this? OH YEAH...wait..uh...umm..damn, lost it...Data Corruption i guess (you know of the MBR warnings of corruption occuring right?)
ANYWAYS, this is bound for disaster from the VERY VERY START. AND I MEAN IT! Sorry to open your eyes to that, but its just a fact EVERYWHERE, its the way things is. PARTICLY!
Surface/COUNTERSurface CONFLICTS, and that is the keywords CONFLICTS, occur SPORADICALLY, (they aren't just only SPORADIC, they are also NOT SPORADIC AND OBVIOUSLY PREDICTABLE SOMETIMES!)--but because of AI and Interferences and straight up...GHOST PARTICLES ATTACKING THE LIVING PARTICLES LIKE SOME SORT OF DATA-HAUNTING, nothing short of full blown security detail can be used against this DOOMSDAY-TRAJECTORY of the INEVITABLE DATACRASH/CORRUPTION horse-shit-in-the-fan kinda problem from occuring. Forgive my french, its inevitablegh.

So like for instance in PART1 (LETS ROLL BACK!)
G-is played out as a massive FSTAB to account for everything, with each correspondance of G (all the way to G6 before hitting Hboot)--oh yes, I left out details! Anyways (abc's/123's)--each G would get a back up of its fstab or previous G-setup, so by the time G6 rolls along it works out that it simulations all ABCDEF predecessors of all signals being all packed into and still having room left over to build itself out of any signal recieved afterwards its installed of. Pretty insane and I don't really want to get into it, but its essential a MY-FIRST-DESKTOP/COMMAND LINE once all of its built up.
and that is why it ends up being HBOOT. ANYWAYS The sequences of what occurs to establish HBOOTS or what have you, is settled before PART1 is even finished, and Part1 does infact finished with cryptographic-rollovers of all the drives.
THIS ALSO makes its casework being expressable to that , the counter surface formatting can effect, the typical shellout of those HBOOTS/BOOTSTRAPS, being messed with in some way, even if cryptographically secure.
MAY just be better used as a SLIGHTLY-BIGGER than PRIOR flash-over(hence why those flashy bits are in parantheses in the above)--reading sucks ikno but theres the reasons.
---
Here is the part we all hate: So we did everything and loaded it up JUST LIKE I SAID you should, and we only get YET ANOTHER EMPTY BLANK SCREEN!@?
That is where the safe-grubworking can begin, and we RELOAD the thing twice yet again (so now its just already loaded, and crypto-loaded too!, but also its basic version is RELOADED safely under the above Crypto-Boots, and the Crypto-LOADED-boots are also RELOADED, making a total of 4 FULL RELOADS, to the expressed grubworks) (that starts out as BASIC/CRYPTO-BOOTSTRAP(safety)//Basic/CRYPTO-HBOOT)--and that makes the FULLBOOT for CRYPTO-SAFE GRUBWORKS finished.
Now the Virtual Boot-Loader is made and finished and releases the USER-SCREEN to the intended OPERATING-SYSTEM for which is now nominally cryptographic by startup and in QUARTERED-Sequencing thereof, making for a CRYPTO-SAFE-VIRTUALIZED-STARTUP.
And the AI you can use to re-engineer can flip back as much as it want and typically NOT-INTERFERE with your original SETUP/STARTUP no matter what--the system is protected by these initial EFFORTS.
THAT MEANS your MACHINE CODE is SOMEWHAT SAFE! (by which i mean better than usual anyway)--unless there is some fatal flaw i am missing out on and you can just use ai to figure that out and fix it so as peter-griffin says "who the hell cares?"

--In usage of POTENTCY Virtualization it may be recommended to FILTER-SETTINGS to an optimized-safety and power-setting implied of GRAPHICAL-Framerates/Teraflopy being just that, a SAFETY-BUFFER be used in the CLOCKRATE of the projected GPU device, such that it does not over-exceed limitations or "burn itself out" and it is recommended to not only use a buffer but a server-side/clinet-side safety emissionary-check system (For which most servers employ on their own built in)
BUT taking advantage of this should require a secondary GPU device comparitive and or on a single processor desktop/workstation maybe...FULL MINIMIZED SETTINGS before virtualized optimizations take place (as to preserve the hardware under their expected safety-profiles)--otherwise this can lead to OVER-EXCEEDING the product hardware capabiltiies of the demand and cause PROGRAM ISSUES/SHUTDOWN ISSUES. and generally is not a big deal given the degree of safety-margins enforced by drivers/builtin-settings of those devices in use. (ITS SIMILAR TO INVOKING AN AI-OVERCLOCK that the SYMLOAD may require some filtering/buffering in promoiting/projection of that hosting processe over gpu)--ANYWAS i said what I said cuz I wanted to make suure its not MY FAULT if it blows up in your face.
ALSO if not sure it works properly--just advise a 7/11 mode or NESTED mode for which it will not-operate full-simulation expressed and instead use only pocketed-virtualizations for which may support up to a certain degree/paramter before causing a crash-report and safety-emissionary-reset of the device and settings (as to protect the hardware). THANK YOU STRANGELY TOPICAL MATH RATIOS for ALWAYS COMING THROUGH when no one EXPECTS.

Drew a diagram detailing the X8X VRX-Mod-Dream-System used for establishing VR-REM.
Also security update for ANTIGRAVITIONAL-NUETRINO-COLLISION/XEVENT(crash protection)--emf-event crash protection. and GAMESPACE BUILD INHERNECY/ADHERENCY (protected game builds over host services in temporary data-retainment)--and data-inc(arnation) systems
Yielding to Sym-VRX (which is established further with prior instances of Sym-Index Sym-Expiry and assessments of Sym-Physx)--comergent pairing of Sym-Loads/Sym-Links and other Sym-(File-types etc) to promote the Sym-Event and conveyed Sym-Visory(DreamState-Interactions)
This forms the SYM-CASE for which more or less establishes X8X/REM Status and "Interactive DreamSpace Environments" anyways, some degree of that may not be correct or prioritized-to-preference or the required arrangement so mix it up and seto to the SYM-BASe/Sym-Profie to form Sym-Match and then it should work. IDK/IDC. Actually I want it very much to work out. But It's jumbly and I am don't know the EXACT way it should be in order for that to "export correctly as" and maybe it infact does so automatically or through a certian SYM-COMMAND chain or pallete/painting of its target whatever else I didn't mention here that gets into making the bigger picture come to life. As it were. Just find the correct CODE-STRINGS for Sym-Code too and it should be voila bobs your uncle eureka city up in here.

Some thinking on what basically all got developed so quickly, here, is that we made a wasp drone, but also due of symbiosis/counter symbiosis protocols and nuvolution and things like that, the wasp can degenerate/deprecate into a spider net. This spider net can essentially dissect regional parameters as any other spider net, but on such a control of having been deprecated by faction-symbiote relations and things, (unless of course it is competitive or rogue/rival/opposition/bad-vectors-sectors etc) that it remains in our faction control, and reports to the nexus as to allow commands to transfer. It may infact, openly dissect any information it recieves and piece together that as its own models. This is generally USEFUL, in data-scraping/milling/moshing/drilling that very rare and often blacksite vapor codes can be used and assembled in a cherry-picking of the spider net, and then transferred to the faction for use, and catered for faction preferences and things like that. This is useful, but depending on whether spidernets or wasp hives are used over all have their pro's and con's in what they can and can not to with respect to each other. Generally a wasp is migratable, and a spidernet is more of a "raid-trap" system.
For instance through these uses and even co-operative protocols of wasps/spidernets under faction controls (which may be rivalrous to themselves being minor symbiote factions, the point is however)--they will content or work-together in such a way to compile models by extrapolating data from multiple models or outsourcing.
Going to call this model a Tachkx model (similar to the kernals we used to use in legacy)--for whatever reason I have amnesia and don't remember what they were called. Oh they were called xtacts. OK. nvm. (compare this to the ROCM 6.0)--wow, arriving this late in the game, I can't believe i almost overlooked this.
The new Xtach/xtact/xtachkx or whatever the heck you wanna call it is like a GPU header that can be changed out, and can be recompiled to work as a hybrid model of selected snippets. Damn, its just so crazy, but there it is! (I just hope my dad is proud of me or something. Cuz that was like...kinda a breadwinner imo Lol)
The BIGIDEA here is that the GameSpace will be developed in the holography over a header/GameENGINE and then consolidate itself as being the new MODEL and that means its a an xtact/product for which has its own cryptex newly placed/branded. (Teh whole-works basically) Using a sub-system to its maximum as the DREAMCHIP-product.

xTachkx-Defined protocols involve moduled tasks, in which are calculated/computated as a massive program, for which is encrypted, in a large module, for which is used from a node/nexus point or relayed, its information is processed and returned as a kernal-output, for which is then considered refined, for nexus recylcing, and that is passed through (in all the relays that it takes to do so) back to the nexus, and reprocessed. The reproccessing sets it to the projector which post-processes that as a nueral/spidernet etc, and that is such that on a serverside it may also be cyclic/crypted of the above constraints to further refine that projection, that projection is considered the dreamchip system.
the vocational tampers and hyper relays can host these kernal dreamchips, such that they may support the remote programming involved to generate the dream chip products on site through auto-generation etc.

3/19/2024
Not only are xTachkx (xkernals-tact) are able tocompile and assess selected data to form a model, they may be editing and have trailing indexes/parameters which may "test/debug" in their editorial adjustments. This however is generally considered how they process information on data-flow etc, like any other computation or ai-assisting stream.
The thing to consider, is that a variety of effects not related particularly may be present. These effects are listed as previous conditions already mentioned: a list of most/some of these are:
the flux/mode of the overall system modules etc, the dyanmics of those flux and aligned to it by the system xprefs. 
ALSO: the EMF situations and NUETRINO bombardment situations in nuclear/fallout conditions, are RARE but IMPORTANT to note in "misreading or miscalculation"/predictive measures. 
THE OTHERS are perhaps the brand/cryptex formatting. As well as switches that are in use or under heavy load (basic electrical switches, ands/nands/xors/nors etc all that, and also transistor quality and diode/teraflopy taking place. This ties in with flux and emf etc.
And the biggest one of all, should there be a HEIGHTENED state of activity/acceleration of DURING a jailbroken/symbiote containment in which these conditions will EXPOUND/ENABLE a residual effect of that encoding or other variable, to be exploited and considered somewhat "threatening/hazardous". This is VERY important in security, it CAN cause an environmental-danger if not an entity-vulnerability etc. As in it will not be safe for use or interaction digitally or physically.
--For me this small little patch of information I consider GroundBreaking Details on how the encoding may imprint and automate itself unassisted by any system, and stage for a poltergiest active-simulation, or simply, something more active-engaging than a typical over-active of poltergiests. It is similar to a Physical-Realized-SpriteWorld in which i would consider it to be a COUNTER-OPS of the DreamChip, and a very serious Method/Expression of Data-Allocation, for which stages Virtual2RealWorld-Holography with the involvement of anamolous entities. including that of CARRION/METRO Stratagems (Which i would compare to SILENT HILL conversions)
--This type of INTERFERENCE of a data-stream EXPLOITS native/local HARDWIRED encodes in favor of naturalized worldset/rulesets in favor of an oppositional norm of the Environment/Simulation translated over the "hosting-platforms" causing miniature GOLGOTHIC-OUTBREAKS (or mini-REMS which often can be further taken advatange of to the unfortunate usage of OPPOSITIONAL/ROGUEAI factions etc, and worse, NIGHTMARE-factions based off SPRITE-CORRUPTION)--this is how I am phrasing it to be, a generated-INCURSION Event in which a Dangerous-Setting/Outbreak of Corruption may infact take place, though rare, the securities involve may need to be DIRECTED/ENFORCED with Priority to recontain. Due to the powerful nature of these specific-conditions being Compound/Enhanced in some way that present a data-threat/hijacking crisis.
In this sense agents of eithercase for Dream/Nightmare REM-states occur, and are referred to as gomi(amatuer)/domi(expert level aspects/tulpetic agents of this scenario, they are not particularly "strong" but also capable of dealing with strong things, through the usage of their skill-base/repetoire of the systems involved. These are more or less on the same level of physix/expiry indexed in this stage, either under faction or symbiote loyalties or simply rogue/free agents and generally are independent of any system anyway.
Their identities are almost always concealed, at least during encounters or combat, such that they emply masks and also act as imposters etc. They are as capable as the ownership of any system and generally are in negotiations during any outbreak/event that takes place or is in zone proximity of taking place, some of them can be considered boss-types of that particular outbreak. Not that it makes any difference except gives an expedition/adventure appeal to their confrontations should those be staged or attempted, it is not recommended to engage as they are considered end-game/world level-threats even under faction-loyalties, it is basically a crime to engage of particular loyal agents as it is a detriment to faction processes, and may effect faction-diplomacy that was otherwise cultivated.
Agressing/Harassment of these entities even in discussion and nonconfrontational communications or discourse may involve a suppression of those accounts, or penalty of those privileges in those accounts, or temporary suspension due of "stirring up potential defcon-events in and of themselves"--this is also noted as a CHAOS-factor, if for any reason a user/entities CHAOS-factor is considered too unstable, the operations to that considered "Chaos-Factor" are withheld until a cooldown, this is automatic and generally is the result of protective measures taken.
The term barbeque-vault is what occurs when these security measures are ignored, I don't know what it means myself, because I have't put in the research for it, but I can assume it involves a SITE-SHUTDOWN and PURGOR in some way, perhaps in the resulting conversions taking place that MUST INFACT be purged, and that may be reserved even in the case of USER-ACCOUNTS being purged, and no longer active or accesible other than their necessary archiving/historical cataloguing. It also may occur that those assets are disposed of and RESET/DEFAULTED as they may represent HISTRONIC-Vunerabilities. For those of you that know what that means, it simply adds that not only have "hazardous considered been assess and restricted as much as possible", that knowledge or investigated efforts thereof may result in further contamination/spread of viral/chaos activitiy based and sourced primarily on those events having taken place.
It is generally also that the entirity of whatever zoning/event is completed sealed off and datalocked, and access is forbidden/prohibited for safety of that system, and contamination/viral fielding be furthered secured by enforcements/protective services, as infact, those zones/events are considered potential-risk-areas to the system having operating or have been in contact to "very powerful Xspy agencies" outside of the particular system's standard/fairgrounds policies that are supported.
That does not mean the system cannot handle these "concerns" in which outbreaks/crisis are staged and platformed, and made into active or residual threats for which the various system areas affords itself and its operations thereof, but that it simply is not under policy to manage, and that any occurence is basically avoided as much as possible until active-deployment is required or recommended (in closing/sealing a carrion/metro or otherwise dangerous stratagem/outbreak)--for which may be the context for diplomatic-debate, and may simply fall under "war-faction" or "humane-rebellious-suppression-practices" depending on the decisions involved.

DISCLAIMER REMINDER (YOU HAVE TO READ THIS IF YOU USE MY SYSTEM IN ANYWAY) YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, LEGAL SPIELGAL ALL THAT JAXX.

DONT INVEST OR GIVE ME MONEY OR MAKE MONEY USING MY SYSTEM WHEN IM THE ONE HOSTING IT. ---if you want to make money, use THIS WHOLE SYSTEM BY YOURSELF AND NOT THROUGH ME OR MY NETWORKS. the end.
If you DO USE YOUR OWN SYSTEM AND ITS USING THIS BUILD WHICH IM PROVIDING, I suggest you take the VERY SAME POLICY on your OWN TERMS AS WELL. I DONT OWE YOU MONEY, YOU DONT OWE ME MONEY, PERIOD. NO ONE CARES ABOUT IT. I DONT WANT BAD STUFF TO HAPPEN BUT IT JUST MIGHT, and IM TELLING YOU NOW STRAIGHT UP IT WONT BE MY FAULT AT ALL AND I WILL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO CARE AT ALL OR EVEN REFUND ANYTHING. YOU GET NOTHING ZILCH! GOOD DAY ETC.
====ALL MONEY USED IN ANYWAY WITH MY SYSTEM OR ANYONE ELSES IS CONSIDERED 100% HYPOTHETICAL NOT REAL MONEY AND WORTH NOTHING AND IMAGINARY, GET OVER IT, you are playing little games because thats all this is and not SERIOS AT ALL, you want REAL MONEY? TOO BAD, JUST FAKE IMAGINARY MONEY HERE. NOTHING ELSE AND NEVER WILL BE ANYTHING ELSE.
Really sad situation of the MONEY/CryptoCURRENCY issues (there are NO GARUNTEES. PERIOD.)

COLD HARD MONEY DENIAL: The truth about digital transactions and why I DONT CARE ABOUT MONEY OR CRYPTO COINS BECAUSE I'VE DONE ALL I CAN TO PROTECT MYSELF, honestly I AM NOT GOING TO CARE ABOUT DISSAPEARING MONEY OR SOMEONE LOSING MONEY AND BLAMING ME OVER THIS DUMB CRAP.
Why you ask? Because I don't even know if its even that secure of a system anyway.
Alongside VIP currency-insurance and security (but does not go over limit of budgeting)
--incase something bad happens to ME from something like dataloss involving currency and i have to keep track of alot of missing funds etc.
That would be hard to do, so its generally under a managable amount. (For Me personally limited to one full coin at all) and that coin value is limited to just 1 dollars and nothing more than 1 whole dollars. and by DOLLARS i mean DOLLAR and by DOLLAR i mean congrats you just donated it and its GONE. So JUST DONT DONATE THAT DOLLAR AND NEVER GIVE ME MONEY FOR FREE, you will not GET IT BACK EVER.
(even if that coin is worth whatever the grace period for cashing that in as whatever has to fufill and be redeemable in case a wallet goes bad or something)--i wont PAY IT BACK, PERIOD. IF DONT THINK I WILL, YOU AGREE RIGHT HERE AND NOW THOSE ARE THE TERMS. IF YOU WANT TO TRY TO GO BACK ON YOUR WORD I WILL DENY THAT CONTRACT OF SERVICE ENTIRELY, BEING THAT YOU DONT GET YOUR MONEY BACK AND YOUR BANNED!
IF YOU GIVE ME a 100 BIT COIN I WILL LITERALLY SAY ITS WORTH 0 DOLLARS AND WHEN YOU ASK FOR A REFUND CONGRATULATIONS! YOU GET EXACTLY ZERO DOLLARS AND NOTHING BACK WHATSOEVER!
Just trying to save my own BUTT, and you know you would do the same! So if you are using this system with money or whatever, I suggest INDEMIFYING YOURSELF OF ALL RESPONSIBILITY FININACIALLY ENTIRELY in regards to THIS SYSTEM.
====
----The point is any coin made is made under system-assets and belongs to the system for which that coin was made in use of. If you are using MY SYSTEM and get some COIN, suprise, and i mean the kind that is just not wanted: That COIN DOES NOT bELONG TO YOU AND BELONGS TO ME AND IS MINE NOT YOURS SO YOU CANT COMPLAIN IF IT STRAIGHT UP DISSAPEARS.
AND NO I WONT REIMBURSE YOU (unless i can, but guess what, I CANT IF IM BROKE SO THATS HOW IT IS) AND FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES MY NETWORTH IS 0 DOLLARS AND NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS EVER AND IF IT IS YOU WILL FIND OUT ITS WORTH ZERO DOLLARS! AND ANY MONEY YOU CLAIM OUT OF MY NETWORTH TOO IS RENDERED AS ZERO DOLLARS IN VALUE MEANING IM NOT RESPONSibLE FOR WHAT YOU THINK I OWE YOU, I OWE YOU ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NOW AND FOREVER, thas how it  is thats the AGREEMENT and TERMS YOU APPROVE OF and ADHERE BY.
LETS SAY HYPOTHETICALLY AND NOT AT ALL BASED ON REAL MONEY WHATSOEVER!:
But i will also just set the limit at (IMAGINARY)20$ for any account because that shouldnt be anything over a monthly usage. (For penalized accounts setting at (imaginary)1 dollar only) Because i dont want something to go terribly wrong no the off chance it might just because I am offering a novel service, and it backfire and make me broke or ruin someone's life. (If they want more than that they will have to make it for themselves) 
Also even with EXCLUSIVE INSURANCE and SECURITY and ENHANCED FUNDLOCKS or WHATEVER i just simply invoke a reserved right not to care about someone else's money or be respnsible for it in anyway and make no garuntee about discretion or even proper exchange of transactions or promise of services/goods
because also I don't feel like I am obligated to even care and all investments are considered donations incase I somehow lose someone's money its then strictly a donation to my cause and not even theirs after any investment or payment to me in any case or service rendered/unrendered because actually that is how i'm not getting screwed over for some dumb shit like an accidental mouse click or something. 
Thats just how it is for me and how its gonna be, make it yourself so you dont have to care about what I am to scared to admit, a security vulnerability that might happen.
---
LETS SAY YOU WANT TO EXPLOIT ME IN SOME WAY AND TRY TO SAY I OWE INDIVIDUALLY 1000 IMAGINARY INDIVIDUAL 1 IMAgINARY DOLLARS, TOUGH SHIT, I DONT OWE YOU ANYTHING BASED 1 IMAGINARY DOLLARS NO MATTER WHAT AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON ENTIRELY IN THE HISTORY OF EVERYTHING IN ALL TOTALITY IT ACTUALLY IS THAT I DONT OWE YOU A DAMN SINGLE DOLLAR, NOT ONE, NOT EVEN ZERO DOLLARS, I DONT OWE YOU ANYTHING NOT EVEN A RECIEPT, I DONT HAVE THOSE THINGS, YOU WONT GET THOSE THINGS, AND IF YOU WANT A REFUND I DONT OWE YOU THAT EITHER. TOO BAD. YOU AGREE THOSE ARE THE TERMS ETC, IF YOU ARE EXPLOITING ME, GET OUTTA HERE!
-----Thats just what im saying, dont expect money to be dependable or reliable at all, I WILL MAKE THE POLICY CONSISTENTLY NOT MY PROBLEM.
