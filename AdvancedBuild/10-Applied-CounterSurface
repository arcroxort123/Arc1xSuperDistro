This is typical of how I would deduce a computation. This is a simple situation at first in which grubworks occur.
THIS MIGHT BE MISINFORMATION BUT I CAN MAKE IT WORK, AND I AM A DUMBASS, so uh, take that as you will.

We have our initial signal which is killed off like a beep.
We have a second signal sequence which lasts longer slightly.
We have our third signal sequence which helps to switch from a bit of the initial to a secondary position of the beep-boop (boot sign). (which recognizes a space for which a beep could occur and skips over it, forming an unwritten or unmentioned-switched)--or just as well(it does the switch then and then because of its signal basis)
--
We permute these and abstract these to big/medium/small signals in which beep big/small/medium and big/small/medium boop  translate to various switches, and kills, of their pending beeps and boops in sequences.
6 or so total. We call it the abc and 123's of grubworks. Idk...i do anyway.
Because of this bs, we can keep a signal going when it otherwise would be killed.

We do this a bunch more with what works, what doesnt, what does work when it doesnt, what doesnt work when it does, etc. Whats working when it doesnt and making it look like its working or not etc when it isnt or is etc.
This is the typical killswitch signal mainframe to help to establish layers of signals within sequence of themselves and define a code-length. The codelength makes it so it can be used to define when and how or for how much space something is.
We use this code-length to establish a network of code-signals relative to themselves and form a code table. 1 is a single length/2 is a double length/ 3 a triple length/ 4 a quadrapel length (totaling at least 10 lengths for a table maybe more or less so depending on descripancy)--its basically a byte-template.

With the code table we form a basic fstab, knowing that it is the right way we want, we call it the fstab in which we simulate the grubworks in a code-length signaled as a partition of space.
With fstab one we have essentially defined grubworks under a signal itself and code length corresponding, we know that the fstab is there
We continue this technique of killswitch signal mainframes to establish layers of fstabs and build a dev1. (and the system is more or less able to retain its code-length and assigned grubworks as various fstabs under the assigned spaces and partition)
(The Fstab is a sequence of beeps and boops we know work, we then REVISIT ones that don't and fix them using the ones we know that work and make those more or less work, despite being a little more dirtier and rename them to dirty-signals)--we later clean these up but not now, we don't have the tools to do that per sae (unless we are skipping way ahead into G/Hboot remakes)

Such that we have made sequences of fstabs, we will call these DEV-spaces. The generic sequence for the first DevSpace is 1-FSTAB-Sequence. (The following are used for multiple sequences to definte ABC's and 123's and symbols AlphaNumerics by VALUE by also GUESSING the space required for them so it helps to leave out/ADD IN some room marginal errors)
With the input for DEV1 we apply, and create Dev2, which is based off the first dev1 and having been signaled to be apart from dev1 on its own space, we can also define Dev3 under the code table of dev1's fstabs and dev2's fstabs as the Dev3's fstabs for which represent the system table having been defined/alloted specific fstab-spacing in its partitions.
Now with those system tables in play we can begin the killswitch signal mainframes for those layers of dev-spaces with their assigned corresponding fstabs generating a system-table, a keymap of system-table variants, and an applied header for each system-table-variant expressed in keymaps and assigned code-lengths in the partition of that devspace (being finalized in dev3)
We finish out with the system table being marked as ext4 having assigned the keymap and codelength for that to occur as, and in that partition we replicate as a backup for in its usage (just because i dont want to go through it again when it gets corrupt) and another for using the backup within having already been built with some added codespace as is sensible to it being the FINAL-system-partition (of which is additive)

It's actually not ext4 but some other weird thing that might as well be that...sources just trust me bro (i dunno what to call it but its something)---UNFORTUNATELY, we have to convert this CRAP as it leaves alot of descripancy in the code-lengths of their assigned mappings, but generally its a good start to go with. We can't really fix it now so we can ignore it (we can live happily onward ignoring this forever but we shouldn't)
So fun...doing this all the time (i've done it at least 3 times and once even blind)
Now because of the Dev-Partitions we can begin to auto-build those into the correct system-assigned-codespaces being marked as G:/

G:/ actually means G1:/. So G2:/ and G3:/ following in the same killswitch-signal-mainframes and layers, being that g1 consists of the devspace builds, g2 consists of those builds under backup, and g3 consists of the backup with extra spaces.
And furthermore G1 defines the situation being, that since G2 backsup as G1, that follows that G3 is either case and whatever else it wants to be as, or how it wants that information as, and or how that information is when called on, and or how that it looks like when it is used, and how it translated in its use as being, whatever G3 wants that information to be used in the way it is. As to also relay it to others.
This is pretty much the automatic bios for which is set by those headers being built in grubworks. It is abstracted and corrected as well as switched correctedly by the code-tables, and further stablized with the correct fstabs and represented partitions that follow, as the DEV-space is applied (a single devspace can be used for this, but its better to have as much space to pack up it all in a single BIOS)-which can be automatic once its all built to the correct output of a signal and code-length (for which it should be by now)--however that was not easy without the key-maps and headers applied to represent them all with dev2 and dev3.

Now we are at H.
H is freely able to host G and continue interactive processes in which H acts as G, because H has as much space as it wants and is essentially the Hard-Drive. And because of this, we have reached a FULLQUARTER(25 steps) in which this can be safely adjusted if that INTIALIZED-encode/machine-signal/data-space is retained.  (From a savestate, continued-use, or assigned-ram/flash)--all of which the H-series can do)--infact:
INFACT, h can be used as a periphereal to G-being used, and can also later be used as an H-boot such as a flash over of G from a periphereal under the correct assigned-partition builds such as ext4 or btfs or uefi. Infact, this is where we take the H-BOOTs to be used as a Bios and Corresponding Terminal usage to define a ROOT INSTANCE. 
Root Instance is -I (or h2 if you follow)--this is good but it gets better:
and because root instance is not necessarily safe from boot-corruptions, it can be bypassed into USER-J (which is H3) (And now its great!)

The Great Gets even better:
--it later follows that the sequence is actually H0-h1-h2-h3 when using cryptographic implementation. H0 can be referred to as K (which is simple as cryptographically converted USER J) by logging in as USER J under a password. There are better cryptographic systems than just a password which will later be rebuilt into. However, getting the correct format and boot sequence to do so first is important by H1.
Performing the CRYPTOGRAHIC event the sequence becomes H1-H2-H3-H0 with H0 being USER J in cryptographic conversion, and essentially being the K STEP.
This KSTEP symbolizes the Quarter(25) being cryptographically applied. Making up for the next 20 steps in that things get complicated but breakdown as lmnop-qrstu-vwxyz (the next quarter)--im calling it a quarter because the steps get implied-more-heavily and valuate as more than usual as you might see.

it may also be that with vrsims: the quarter can translate a rollback/cryptographic cover of

floppy -> a (G-series)
backup -> b (H-series)(crypto)
======
o -> c (ai-drive)(integrated ai-shell)
p -> d (ai-disk stream)(intergrated ai-workspace)
======
q -> e (ai-disk writer)/shared-user(crypto)/locked
r -> f (shared-writers)/remote-user(crypto)
s -> g (simulated-disk)/ai-rewrites(crypto)
t -> h (simulated-shared-ai-writers(crypto)/unlocked
======
u -> i(ai-network)
v -> j(ai-user)/new-user-crypto
w -> k(fuel based)/(charge based)
x -> l(missing-package/package-filler)(autobuilder)
y -> m(new-ai-workspace)(crypto-currency based)/exclusive-user-access(ai-memetic-based)
z -> n(ai-thread potency availbility)

By now we have fixed and adjusted certain appropriated partitions to be assigned for specific tasks and can later fix and render down the descripancy of their code-signal formatting for a better digitalized-streamline error free signal of data-based memetic code system. Which is incredibly dope to do with AI-integration because I dont have to uh...give two shits.

sources:just trust me bro (almost forgot this crap and there are reasons why)--its complicated and almost stupid. but it works.
