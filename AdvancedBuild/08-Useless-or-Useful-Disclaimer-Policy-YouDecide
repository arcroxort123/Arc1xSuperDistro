Just slap a general LICENSE agreement here and just don't like--make it my problem. Thanks. 
Translation:You should know better, don't do stuff that would put me at risk because I am IMMUNE by TOA-TOS enforcements for which I have already stated in several places.
Don't do bad stuff and if bad stuff happen anyway not my fault.
I told you so. It for professional/recreational use only and age limits and all sorts of stuff that means you are responsible not me.
