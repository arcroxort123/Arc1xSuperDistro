I want to expound on my theories using a theoretical device. In this case a particle computer.
This computer is simply built on an interpretation of its data through a registry. This is the truth of the computer, all that needs to be indexed and "briefed" upon occurs here.

The computer interacts with the registry in a way that defines its identity.
The registry may explain a data to the computer as being "SAND"
That is the first knowledge of the computer having registered that particle in data.
The data may or may not directly represent a quotient of sand, but the value of that entry imples that it exists based on the data having been registered.
That in theory can be data that is held in a vram of the computer's devices.

Once that vram is written, it may be assumed it was even written on a particle itself, that the data has been written on a particle representing what that data is because that particle is now imprinted with data and saved physically.
That is the difference of vram to a particle, that the vram is theoretical and the particle is physical. The tracking of that data is involved that it has occured, and therefore exists as an imprint, for wherever that particle is or will go.
Until it is further subject to more data-imprinting, the expression of data-to-particle has taken place in a comparitive proof defined by the registery.
