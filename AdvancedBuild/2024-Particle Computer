I want to expound on my theories using a theoretical device. In this case a particle computer.
This computer is simply built on an interpretation of its data through a registry. This is the truth of the computer, all that needs to be indexed and "briefed" upon occurs here.

The computer interacts with the registry in a way that defines its identity.
The registry may explain a data to the computer as being "SAND"
That is the first knowledge of the computer having registered that particle in data.
The data may or may not directly represent a quotient of sand, but the value of that entry imples that it exists based on the data having been registered.
That in theory can be data that is held in a vram of the computer's devices.

Once that vram is written, it may be assumed it was even written on a particle itself, that the data has been written on a particle representing what that data is because that particle is now imprinted with data and saved physically.
That is the difference of vram to a particle, that the vram is theoretical and the particle is physical. The tracking of that data is involved that it has occured, and therefore exists as an imprint, for wherever that particle is or will go.
Until it is further subject to more data-imprinting, the expression of data-to-particle has taken place in a comparitive proof defined by the registery.

(Registery + Data + Imprint)( Particle + Expression + Proof) is the determinant to the computer device, that it may envision itself based off various properties or attributes made further in representation.
That a Registry translates several affairs and protocols.
That the Data occurs based off either Vram or Physical Translation.
That the Imprinting occurs based on that processing of vram or physical translations.
--
That the particles involved are required logic-pathways in representation to data.
That their expressions may be different values in comparison (and require protocols)
That the proofing of may or may not be according to the processing that took place.
--
Defines the whole of the particle computer to all of its devices.
---With this knowledge combined I can then define several allocations of data in such a way to program and process accordingly the behavoir of the data-particle relationship to further redefine the universal indentity of my computer.

So the objective of computing through particles is to achieve a symbiosis of data/particles.
For instance the registry will set the values of what the particle truly is to the computer.
What the registry will assign as manageable to the computer's operations and how much of a particle can handle the data in transmission.
All the particle loss and gain required to sustain a persistant imprint for allocating and setting to a course in vram transmission.
How that relationship will continue to set the pace for processing further translations and expressions by comparison, to an ultimate proof of protocol in practice.

That given the data space of the device, the most important goal is to set a roadmap of all potential particle usage. Their types and limitations.
That through the corrective measures in allocating data through these particles one can set a theoretical working machine in all its part on a virtual "table" and begin to process or negotiate a protocol of their usages.

That the Full Road-MAP can be used under a registry for any device as well within the system Table which may also share the same relationships having been built on particle/data as well.
This very quickly allows a matrix of devices for which will appear to be a Particle-Based Computer
This forms the cryptex or overall-core-expression of the objects for which the computer has developed itself component of.
This cryptex is more or less a kernal or "kernal negotiation" of the architecture of the entire computing chain involved of all the device/components used.

This may change in its layout or comprised effects, but overall signifies the kernal of the machine, and that it should be retained and "secured" over all data transfer and movements of the machine itself.
It should be recoverable and replaceable in case of a conditional mis-use or disruption of its data, that it may require a backup or an inactive substitute to its own orientation, it may require a clone. Simply put.
