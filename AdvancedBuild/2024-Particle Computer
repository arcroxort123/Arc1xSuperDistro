I want to expound on my theories using a theoretical device. In this case a particle computer.
This computer is simply built on an interpretation of its data through a registry. This is the truth of the computer, all that needs to be indexed and "briefed" upon occurs here.

The computer interacts with the registry in a way that defines its identity.
The registry may explain a data to the computer as being "SAND"
That is the first knowledge of the computer having registered that particle in data.
The data may or may not directly represent a quotient of sand, but the value of that entry imples that it exists based on the data having been registered.
That in theory can be data that is held in a vram of the computer's devices.

Once that vram is written, it may be assumed it was even written on a particle itself, that the data has been written on a particle representing what that data is because that particle is now imprinted with data and saved physically.
That is the difference of vram to a particle, that the vram is theoretical and the particle is physical. The tracking of that data is involved that it has occured, and therefore exists as an imprint, for wherever that particle is or will go.
Until it is further subject to more data-imprinting, the expression of data-to-particle has taken place in a comparitive proof defined by the registery.

(Registery + Data + Imprint)( Particle + Expression + Proof) is the determinant to the computer device, that it may envision itself based off various properties or attributes made further in representation.
That a Registry translates several affairs and protocols.
That the Data occurs based off either Vram or Physical Translation.
That the Imprinting occurs based on that processing of vram or physical translations.
--
That the particles involved are required logic-pathways in representation to data.
That their expressions may be different values in comparison (and require protocols)
That the proofing of may or may not be according to the processing that took place.
--
Defines the whole of the particle computer to all of its devices.
---With this knowledge combined I can then define several allocations of data in such a way to program and process accordingly the behavoir of the data-particle relationship to further redefine the universal indentity of my computer.
