06-Fusion-Cryptex-Exchange

With the previous ENDWORKS coming to a conclusion. The takeaway begins that the LAMP-symbiote-Node-Coin can be in place of CRYPTEX(icons or otherwise) and Headers (for which are generally virtualized over the hypervisory of that node)--for which is why Lamps work so well with them in clusters and (able to induce arrays for minions and wards)
This simply is done that the DRONE that is designed can harbor a CRYPTEX of its own and escort other RESERVE-cryptex for which is counter-base to any other BUILT-IN Cryptex and can be exchanged and used in routing of data/power and just anything it feels like REPLACING as a module with a cryptex-infused-module or even MODEL-ENHANCED-CRYPTEX for which is then placed into node/frameworks/chambers/kernals/lamps/modules/visory for commodifiable usage.
BASICALLY it is that with the cryptex and securities in place the LAMPS can then escort/exchange their ambience/built-in cryptex between other "cryptex place holders" and also enhance the native/local outputs and metas for which adhere to environmental x-types (and can attemptively implant cryptex where so desired to as a median for "not having cryptex or using as a KEYWORD" for which these CRYPTEX may be set-upon and enforced by policy or ruleset to induce their modified status or allowances/prohibited functions for which COUNTER/COMPILE the active-CRYPTEX supplication/substitutions of those OBJECTS/CLASSES

THIS is mostly done with DRONES/LAMPS/WARDS/NODES that in someway ROUTE/RELAY CRYPTEX-TRAFFIC and can schedule and COMPTROLL for CRYPTEX-EXCHANGE or other Currency-Swaps and Coin-Token Usages. Which Is GOOD in mitigate and prioritizing certain STRATEGY/STRATAGEM for efficiency/productive or security measures as they may be needed.
As with all x-types and their SUPPOSED/ASSUMED Cryptex-Inherentcy/Adherentcy this is encouraged that some are at any LEVEL/TIER able to also counter/affiliate with (in their alleviations or otherwise their diplomacies or distributive properties) INTERACT directly/indrectly EFFECT other Symbiote/Rival instances and just as well train or empower the modules concerned/considered for those Occupancies of EITHER casework or assigned-emulations or anything like that. Which is just a way of saying. There are perks/additional PROPERTIES for which the Cryptex may account for and provide/protect/prevent/inhibit in some way SUSTAIN to the benefit/detriment of for which that are placed.
This includes weather/chaos and all sorts of things for which the lamps and their TRAFFICING of Cryptex Enhancements are passively SUBJECTED to IN-ENROUTE or OUT-ENROUTE inbound/outbound various stations/waypoints or ETA of their DEPLOY/LAUNCH and Housing/Encampments for which they may also be BEACON/CONDUIT of in any form of contiguity that may apply from any DIMENSIONAL SHIFT that also may apply including ACCELERATION THEREOF.

These exchanges of CRYPTEX may also be temporary/contest for which they are rendered/nullified in the presence of GREATER PRIORITY for which is to be determined by VICINITY/PROXIMAL exchange in either Combat/Ownerships in Delegated Handles/Placements ETC.
There may be INSTANCES in which a ROGUE-CRYPTEX may be placed/manuevered/plotted/subject in some way or wording in some description INVOLVED where it is not considered NORMAL due to "meddling or expeditionary" just because of the travel/collective-trafficing of those cryptex in any-platform. FOR INSTANCE a non-native HEADER/MODULE may also support these cryptex or they may also be INFUSED with Adhoc-ROAMING LAMPS/Sentries or applied in STATIONARY/ENGINE-MODULES such as LOCK-PASS/GATE-WAYS/DOOR-FRAMES/RESOURCES/DOWNSWELLS/PHEERMONI/STATUES/CHESTS/POSTS/PONES/POOLS/PLUGS/SOCKETS and especially SHRINES and any likely CONTAINER/DEVICE for example. For the uses and potential is broad and largely undefined in possibilities for which these now can occur (IF IN FACT THAT AREA IS LIKELY SUPPORTING THE EXCHANGE OF CRYPTEX AT ALL BEING ONLY MADE APPLICABLE BY EXTREME ADVANCEMENTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PRESENCES OR SPECIFIED OWNERSHIP OF NODE and TECH)
THESE "Optional Operations" may also redefine BOSS-CAPTIVITY or PROC-CHANCES within the area/zone and may effect Environmental/Geometry in minute/medium fashions acting as REMOTE-operators to the Scenario in which they are applied (for instance altering DUNGEONEERING SPAWNS or EXPEDITIONARY EVENTS) --For better or worse but can ALSO be modified and DENOTED in forecast (for which due to advancements may also be edited or rearranged or even applicable at all).
