With the previous ENDWORKS coming to a conclusion. The takeaway begins that the LAMP-symbiote-Node-Coin can be in place of CRYPTEX(icons or otherwise) and Headers (for which are generally virtualized over the hypervisory of that node)--for which is why Lamps work so well with them in clusters and (able to induce arrays for minions and wards)
This simply is done that the DRONE that is designed can harbor a CRYPTEX of its own and escort other RESERVE-cryptex for which is counter-base to any other BUILT-IN Cryptex and can be exchanged and used in routing of data/power and just anything it feels like REPLACING as a module with a cryptex-infused-module or even MODEL-ENHANCED-CRYPTEX for which is then placed into node/frameworks/chambers/kernals/lamps/modules/visory for commodifiable usage.
BASICALLY it is that with the cryptex and securities in place the LAMPS can then escort/exchange their ambience/built-in cryptex between other "cryptex place holders" and also enhance the native/local outputs and metas for which adhere to environmental x-types (and can attemptively implant cryptex where so desired to as a median for "not having cryptex or using as a KEYWORD" for which these CRYPTEX may be set-upon and enforced by policy or ruleset to induce their modified status or allowances/prohibited functions for which COUNTER/COMPILE the active-CRYPTEX supplication/substitutions of those OBJECTS/CLASSES
