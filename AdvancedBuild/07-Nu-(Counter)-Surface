A potentially unaccessible or non-entry unenterable unsafe surface for which may constitute an arena and which can be negotiable to which is interactive of its defined-permissions.
Involves Captured-Origin(flashover)/Cryptex-Sacrement/ScrewBalling-Source/Surface-Exchange being mounted in some order as to ascertain a reversal of encodes from NuSurface-to-Standard-Surface
Once prepped and executed the interaction reseats the mount-headers as native/local and rebuilds the visory to the headers-commissioned realm-integrated node-space. This can also be exchanged once finalized.
Fusion Cryptex can be readjusted over this module (which may be moved having been contained as realm-encode-native/local builds integrated to the header/supported visory for which is nested in nodespace)-and its image reseatable per preference of system priority/assigned-header-kernals.
It can change its operating system as needed and prioritized through token selection. This is done over the supported shell out of the node interactive command line or even its bin/bash for easy switching of OS per src.
The commanding NODE-policies allow and enforce token usage to be regulated to acceptable kernals of the over-riding and main-branched Nexus/DataCenter (Server) for which may or may not accept symbiote kernals as they contaminate nodespace and grant ownership of nodespace to symbiote preferences, however FACTION-symbiote tokens may be applied (but also may be limited due to regulations assigned)
Once installed that Node can be median/interpretor of the kernal headers for which it houses and has rebuilt. Such that it may be effected but under priorities does not effect the main-command chain as it is "subsystem to"
Symbolic Links may be applied to mitigate or in some descripancy allow externalized code instance in node-control.
Firewalls and Bridged Connections may be policy enforced as well as AV-security ETC.

As stated the options provide that the The headers may be reseated and the hypervisory can be remounted over the NODESPACE which hosts the headers and the visory. The NODESPACE may also be swapped out or removed or moved due to DATA-EXCHANGE and Cryptex Modifications over the "Package State" for which it is represented in. This accounts for all supporting kernals the nodespace may have "chambered" as its own bash-line-selections(shebangs).
VPN standards or fairground adjaceny may assist or grant alloted usage of gridwork addresses.
Node Relocation May require a suspension of services of those kernals/visory however the node does not necessarily need to shut down (but it is preferred that its subsystem/nestedVMwares are)
It may further require that its hosted processes adhere to template/model environments of the native/local ownerships for which are policy enforced by the overall site-management *(Nexus Main-Branch)
--
However the idea is that the headers may be swapped and the data-retained as processes are rebooted within hypervisory under the hosting NODE, in order to achieve ADAPTIVE-compatibility of several repo/distro assign/appointment. From which is subsidy and policy enforced to the MainBranch-Nexus. (Only applicable distros of preferences may be used with minimal security etc)
And those applicable distro's may be selectable as bash-line versionary.
In HIGH security Network May be LIMITED for safety-measures to afford symbiote-kernal usage. If desired it may also be operable under quarantine on-site via remote scheduling.
Even Faction-Symbiote Priorities may be preffered under heightened security, and also node-relocation may be restricted in lockdowns/high-security events. Due to the nature of the symbiote-cryptex relationships and contested zoning for which may weaken protections or expose vulnerabilities under lax security.
LampSET-Nodes may also offer remedial-upkeep and diagnostic negotiations under any security protocol so its good to have one around, so long as flux-reactions remains in faction-favorability.
Some lampsets may require intepretation-contracts and agreements/compatbility prior to providing any serviced negotiation or communication. Acting as a SPECIAL-CASE-AGENT/ASPECT--SystemNodeASSET.

Also under added security certain spy protocols and occupations may be restricted/forbidden/prohibited in the nature of confidential-sourcing and other issues in which may pose risk to site-routines as well as forced deweaponization and ordinance-policies may also be in strong-effect.
NodeSites are very adaptive in applying necessary policy enforcement and leiniancy where requested by the proper authorizations in overall SITE-COMPLIANCE.

NUSURFACE instances may be considered COUNTER or also CRYPTEX INSTANCES themselves to the symbiote for which may expound or attemptively takedown and become hostile and aggressive at any moment's notice so it must be lockeddown and quarantined if that is the case that a symbiote is in occupancy/residency. Due to Defcon being effected from any Stage to Maximum-RISK/threat it is always required that a notification of symbiote occupation has been authorized and confirmed.
Power Reserves and Capilliated-Systems must always be at maximal storage capacity and fully charge in the case of an emergent symbiote outbreak at any level and may be removed by Nexus-Command-Chain at anytime during an outbreak/evac (in which the node is shutdown and fully purged)--quite quickly and a backup or substitute instance may be rerouted.


DataBase Routing and Shareholds of Ecto/Ichor Token Currencies and Rates.
These may be shared between nodespaces under Faction/Rgional Nexus Servers. However may be reappropriated at anytime for any reason between sites.
Nodes May share some pathological routings between other Likewise NODES along their redirected addresses over vpn and are under monitor for extended shareholding or comergence for which is desginated in conjunctions of. (This syncs to the standard ENDWORKS-NODE) and formulates with AFTERSPACE libraries.
Nodes may share Lockdown Limits for any reason assigned by the Nexus because of other share regulations in effect. (These may compound and be prolonged for any reason or security measure)
Instances of these achieving Counter/Cryptex Level Compatibility are notified over Defcons, for which may also become limited and enforced with any reason of revocation of services at any time.

DATABASE-POLICY ENFORCEMENT
A sample Symbolic link may consist of a defined/redefined logsystem/database explaining acceptable adaptive practices/regulations per NODESPACE issued and may be shared between other Nodespaces/AfterSpaces.
A sample may be considered GREEN(problem free)/Yellow(MildProblems)/Red(Problems)/*(purple revisted problems or issues or notes)
These may change overtime or be applied for other shareholds or nodespaces/afterspaces in which also may be shared under and included of other shareholds (such that it may be profiled repeatedly)--and ORANGE(multi-profiled and important)
These files are largely considered important in handling and maintaining adaptive-nodes in their constant or consistent change-outs for which "Nodes may also be reassigned under their own ArenaSpace in using Afterspace)--having been fully locked-down and quarantined of their lamps and other affordances/amnenties and under Schedule/Routine Evaluation thereof in Examination/Inspection of and Policy Enforcement thereof for the remainder of their contract (for which may be revoked or altered at any time in STANDARD-REALM-COMPLIANCE)--for which is also adaptive to the Diplomacy and Sovereignties under Regional-Practice.
The only reason this is a big deal is if the nodespace is desirably or has some actual value to its cryptex/indexed resourcing (and is not at all an actual residency/occupation for ACCOUNTHOLDERS)--but in the level of ICHOR-TOKEN-CURRENCY it is a necessary institutional-ruleset to have maximal security thereof (in the case of TOKEN OWNERSHIP) in someway effected OVERALL NEXUS-REALM-STATUS. For which is tracked/monitored/surveyed/maintained over UPKEEP and Reports thereof.

NEXUS --> NODE ownerships may be exchanged as contract by account-users in token-allowances.
For instance someone may want an enhanced Robotic-Adaptive-Distro consisting of their select Distro's of choice and that can be provided for by the Nexus under alloted-slot-space for which generally is reserved 1 per customer and may infact be shared/timeshared.
