A potentially unaccessible or non-entry unenterable unsafe surface for which may constitute an arena and which can be negotiable to which is interactive of its defined-permissions.
Involves Captured-Origin(flashover)/Cryptex-Sacrement/ScrewBalling-Source/Surface-Exchange being mounted in some order as to ascertain a reversal of encodes from NuSurface-to-Standard-Surface
Once prepped and executed the interaction reseats the mount-headers as native/local and rebuilds the visory to the headers-commissioned realm-integrated node-space. This can also be exchanged once finalized.
Fusion Cryptex can be readjusted over this module (which may be moved having been contained as realm-encode-native/local builds integrated to the header/supported visory for which is nested in nodespace)-and its image reseatable per preference of system priority/assigned-header-kernals.
It can change its operating system as needed and prioritized through token selection. This is done over the supported shell out of the node interactive command line or even its bin/bash for easy switching of OS per src.
The commanding NODE-policies allow and enforce token usage to be regulated to acceptable kernals of the over-riding and main-branched Nexus/DataCenter (Server) for which may or may not accept symbiote kernals as they contaminate nodespace and grant ownership of nodespace to symbiote preferences, however FACTION-symbiote tokens may be applied (but also may be limited due to regulations assigned)
Once installed that Node can be median/interpretor of the kernal headers for which it houses and has rebuilt.
