EVEN MORE EXTRAS (a small bit i forgot to add in)--(not sure how much more i forgot to add)--dont really care--its all to expedite a build based off whatever i typed---i already shared to minecraft build itself

and some screen shots, and i can review what i missed, its actually just whatever i put down on a sign at this point (i might have missed a few screenshots here and there but i can quickly find the sign for it---for instance or just retype what i think i forgot)
--there are only like a thousand signs to look through and most of them are broken into groups or placeholders for actual buildings anyway with short details of buildings

below are 1500 slides that detail some of the xnav early builds and some of the 2023-comments (so beginning and end of the main project)---i dont really care and this whole process has been dehumanizing, i just dont really care about having a good opinion on anything lol...just knowing that no one also cares, thats not really encouraging either but whatever, i know its maybe important if you needed a system like this.

Like i said, most of everything has already been written up, the extras are simply extras that aren't really needed to mention, glossing over what is already stated in LEGACY and other Virtual/Later Builds. The extras was supposed to be for fun in case i missed any details, im not going to obsess over it more than i already am.

Though, it is a fact that I retouched on some things and invented the NOX/Anima System Supports from that, i think its just good to have it more or less complete in its entirity of what I could possibly cover past/presently. ALSO, i am a disorganized mess and the least I can really do is just take a duplicate lines check on everything (this will cut down on alot of bulk, but also will cut out some "arrangements" of complexes so that is why I just tolerate the repeated lines, they are all symbolic of being redone in some way" for a REASON. (To reference or articulize the objects mentioned for that particular segment)---One case would be the repeat space of the DYNAMO model being rebuilt for a TURRET (its the exact same model and process except with a TURRET now)---and its a HUGE PROCESS to had to type out, so instead of writing double the lines, I just made a giant GAP in the Development to suggest that is where to copy over the Dynamo-TURRET (everything is linear in that way)----and in fact, if I did remove duplicate lines entirely, there would be a huge "lapse" of clarity in some of the building processes throughout development.

Because bits and pieces would be straight up revoked in places leaving gaps and dents where there shouldnt be. (holes in theory)--while this is not often, it sometimes is -critical- lol.

So if I rewrite something by accident its generally no big deal compared to the big deal it would be if i cut something important out in an attempt to look clean. That being said, the whole document is somewhat choppy/flawed in that repetitive banter and etc, and I feel putting these frames back in might help (because it clearly is missing 1500 frames of whatever whereever---I will date them to make sure---but i certainly did not care at the time of write up because they are all mostly extra slides)---just helpful to include them

and they are dumb and choppy because i expect an automatic-coder to figure out how to use them somehow as is how they were typed. If i wanted to put in all the slides in their original form, THERE WOULD be 42k some odd screenshots that roughly focus on minor-changes or overall major chapter works that can be expressed in text or corrective code functions anyway, and that 42k slides was like 60GB because of the excessive quality used for them.
Of course I can't exactly upload or even host not to mention keep track of with them being in a "hodge-podge" of folders that i barely kept organized over the 4-5 years of building through it.

You see, I was not intended for this type of project. But yet I did so anyway.
I know I could have been more professional about it, but I am an UNPAID amatuer and the project was originally a private endeavor because of how stupid it was to do. I realized I started something that was more complicated then expected and managed to finish it more or less anyway LOL. There are far better ways of handling the system I built, the minecraft BUILD is there, but also (its very big and often times just slapped together)--though, while it is more or less orderly, IMO, from a glance, you can see I just winged EVERYTHING and just more or less it came out the way it did (and i rationalized everything in the process including the mistakes i made to the effect...that it makes sense in the build the way things are, sure it can be "improved and optimized" in placement or even in design, but down to the very detail, it really doesnt matter as long as I took the steps to get there in a more or less cohesive fashion, which i feel I did more or less 60% of the time, seems good to me, I actually would rate my model to be a B+ if not A (and if you are not nitpicky)---(and can imagine it being perfect)---then it probably is close enough on most fronts. Just my opinion, I feel like It is preddy-gud. 

If i wanted to rebuild everything, It would be a solid STRIP of "roadside" buildings expressing their correct functions in a fair and equal trade off of each other's performances" and a massive frontier base of several other "abs works of buildings that more or less cluster and network in a randomized state to achieve optimal yield, (through an ensemble of armature/engine/auxilliary/sequence/POWERRESERVES that resemble my ENDZONE BUILD---which i can post in a massive screen shot anyway) So basically it is like a giant table cloth of buildings with a core-stem/rail and toplevel-automative surface (or powerblock if you will)
---when you see this thing, it looks like a massive REGION of buildings developed for mass production (over 10square miles or so) that just "strip mine data and produce titan-level anima-engines for said data and expedtionary"--it is a dungeon in itself, of buildings and routines, and it ultimately is used to make a moon-base with its own raid-system for the very same efforts afforded of cloning its entire region. So we have a future-modernized colonization device/system. Depending on how you want to use it, or a virtual platform for simulated user world-realm experiences. Depending on how you want to use it...both for recreation and survival, or business/production (campaigns/expeditionary/adventure/excursion/expansion)
That's the way I built it, should last more or less and being able to stand on its own.

SOME 1000ODD Slides I FORGOT to add: (im not going to do these right yet cuz there is alot and i wasnt hoping to spend my day on it lol)

CURRENTLY THERE ARE 5 ROWS OF NUCLEAR AUXILLIARY DESIGNED TO PRODUCE DETERIUM BARRELS(H3)
---Which is only further assisted with the additional ANIMA-CENTRIFUGE SYSTEM BEING DEPLOYED AS THE SANCTUM
it is being CONSIDERED TO ALTERNATE THESE AUXILLIARIES WITH THEIR OWN THERMAL POWER RIGGING (TO FURTHER ASSIST IN PRODUCTION)---in which WE CAN MASS PRODUCE THE REACTOR SPACE FOR EACH OR PUT IN A SLOTTED RIG OF THE REACTOR SPACE BETWEEN EACH AUXILLIARY ASSISTING THEIR CORRECTIVE/ASSIGNED RAILS
SO WITH 5 AUXILLIARIES they can be an ASSISTING REACTOR-LANE FOR EACH (and while ONE REACTOR IS ENOUGH)--we can inject a FULL THERMAL RIG INTO PLACE) MEANING THE ENTIRE THERMAL LANE AND MULTIPLE REACTORS AS DECIDED/PREFERRED TO FIT FOR EACH LINE-UP. 
THAT MEANS IF THE RIG CONSISTS OF 5 REACTORS IN THE SAME LANE, AND ALL THE TYPES ARE SUPPORTED, IT CAN ALLOW FOR POWER AND DRONE SERVICE PER LINE UP. MEANING ALSO 5 DRONE CAMPS OVER THE ENTIRE NUCLEARFAB AREA.
im very tired and want to make it clear
The AUXILLIARY LINEUP can be ASSISTED with a THERMAL RIG of any type of setup including just bare minimum to OPTIMIZED conditions and installments there of
AND WE HAVE 5 auxilliary lineups for this so while any amount of thermal rig can ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF IT, each individual can be assisted which would require nothing but installing and mass producing (by order--that installment)--which basically is already automatic and so it can be simply copy/pasted over to fit.
THE RECOMMENDED CASE IS TO USE ONE OF EACH REACTOR, for which IS ALREADY DEFAULT TO THE COPY PASTE AND REQUIRES NO FURTHER ADJUSTMENT OTHER THAN TO SIMPLY INSTALL IN THE SPACE ALLOTTED FOR EACH LINE UP. SO IT IS BASICALLY A NO BRAINER TO DO. AT THE TIME OF HAVING TO WRITE UP THESE MISSING 1k SLIDES, I RATHER JUST BUILD THIS BUT I KNOW I SHOLD WRITE UP EVERYTHING BECAUSE THATS MORE IMPORTANT IN THE LONG RUN.
plus i am harassed so much that i might just revoke the whole project altogether---but im not going to because i know its important. i'm just tired of thinking for no benefit other than 'inventor's clout'---whatever imaginary crowd favor i am getting for making this (TO BE HONEST THO IM MORE HARASSED THAN ANYTHING)


11/05/2021
During the Build I was working admist a population of what i assume would effect somewhat to a degree of several 100 people until maybe 1000s were somewhat in "an area of effect of me building this in which" their traffic may have been repetitive or such that i would keep count as to "the traffic considered during the project built" reaching upwards of maybe 150k various traffic-counts taking place and over all in the furthest reaches of my build it may effecting upwards of that count in terms of people (who may or may not have contributed in some way because im none the wiser though i was definitely harassed regardless of their doing or not"
I was building and gaming mostly through the time of this development, other games not just minecraft.
I have some grievances but are largely discounted though admist 3k repetitive trafficed "users/drivers"
as well as a guesstimate of 15k harassments of third party involvements im not sure why maybe i deserve it or not idk maybe its competitive idc i just try to focus on the work at hand for now but i will say that it was alot of harassment
plus i have mental issues so i just dont think about what i say and just put it down in case its true later or something idk, i dont like to hold onto thoughts but i write them out if they bother me enough
2019 ORDEALS: things that are mostly to paint the picture of the general world-status taking places out of my hands but what im working in the midst of here:
World and personal tragedi
world threats national threats
national leader conflicts
Some problems that were basically being shoved in my face that arent really my concern but are a world level issue at the time (to paint the scene of my working conditions and why im not really going to pay attention i write these down so i can basically forget about it or look back on it):

Each full mapview is estimated 20 to 24 lanes of complexes (i have)
i have a 4 castles road that can border this full map view (it could but now its only like 20% the legnth of the total Rail-Path)--not including prosper
one lane is also one horizon long so i own a flat view map at large
will fit the square gridwork of this complex tulpasect
a horizone is six or so lanes wide so two horizones side by side

MOSTLY all the missed slides are a scratch up which I have and will write out as the first sections of the rail + ANY OTHER SCRATCHUP SIGNS TO INCLUDE (which there may be a few as I write out this document)
I will attempt to describe all the stages by writing them out ABOVE! or Below in the remainder of this document as well as purvey any other missed slides I forgot to include (IN THE INCLUSION OF THIS--we have outlined the intial stages  of the first aux systems which became a FAB 
(these also were touched up slightly overtime) and those touchups are more or less included, here and throughout the entire documents and extras collections. I am just under alot of harassment and disorganized but i think i got 99% of everything. If i missed something its already in the map file too
Also the map file may not be to expectation and have personal opinions sometimes like my track-records and things like why im harassed and my feelings towards why i built under said harassment, sorry, but its the entire weight of the development process IMHO because it effected me personally throughout.



Some 500 ODD Slides I forgot to add:
So without further hold up:
10/18/2021
upon entry to reszone area we must be within flux rights and upon (entry) we exist with disembodied flux
to do this we use pi/phi breaking its no big deal or we also just re-automate by changing eco (this effects nox/anima builds)
by using folded reciprocation of the warp tary as well
when the synx reaches its armament state (of being tech geeared) it becomes the uluxurate
which is a reference to a luxurious kindred of benevolence of fortune (but often is a wildkin)
it can also appear to be blessed with hex/extreme luck or simply be possessed by a poltergeist
able to replace pure minera chordal form kernal to viral corrupted data banks as well
as form of sabotory (sabotage, subversion,subterfuge , subposition)
the sabatouer agent does precisely that akin to demography
using the sequencing in order to generate a corrupt void space (similar to atomizing)
these is linked directly throughput active or permissive accounts so it cannot just randomize
shown as an illuminated salience quo that may or may not be infused with warez elementiums
oratar chordal patterns may occur as permutable source indexing (so it is labeled as warez)
and can be done so diplomatically but also through general hostile approaching as its denoted
it also uses quantum fuel signaling with diodal infusion (i know what it sounds like) to occur
it is used as a fully expressed quantum ship known as a vindicator (or a vector class ship)
the outfit uses sabatours and orator hybrids (which are more like t16+)
--
usually to carry their own warez elementium or (quantum elementium)
they are also able to use wyverns (or mana-wyverns or wyrms) as wards that are invisible
basically why they are link kindred
and can pretty much substitute anything it wants with anything it rather have instead or trap
is mostly a raid device entity (and defend against raids as a ohm-agent---infosec-operative)
very helpful in accidental hostile encounters as well (and can restore areas to original layouts including basic npc implementation over meta/ambient phase etc---if enabled to do so, it can if it is a special case)
the intel of the ops is used in a pamphlete that describes a super battle cruiser in quantum
so we use this with the vindactator using it also represents the esper class t16+ mentioned
it lites up in use as its quantum initiated
it uses a exoskeleton made of cryolline filament (cluster dust) and which prims and encrusts
123 and then forms the exo skeleton in spyragic (lavos spiking) and basic ferrousizes itself
its 123-4 and 5 in quantum space
making it 16x or 32x compatible if not just simply the 17th tier of our measures
it forms a tulpetic quill elementium that it is fused to as well for insulation of the pilot in mana (nox/anima compatible)
the break away puck is conjoined or conjugated with a sheath or joist puck (same thing)--(applied signature useful in anima/nox)
it is spun to a locked or unlock position around any path route or gola posting (in betweens)
but dont tell anybody that part (becuase they might price change shit)
it is how entry is also granted into beveled pilot bays
--
of course, mech suits
it functions as a quasi-modo lock

FILLING IN THE first of the ALTERNATE THERMAL PANELS

10/20/21
*harassment obstruction
but the fact remains they intetionally impeded this advancement
--the death angel(lich) model of the deathclaw armor gonna be used in a way blast shield (trying to nuvolve)
so the raid-brain can be blast shielded
possibly preventing ploss in redzones (expo)
such like a dark templar that can fly

10/20/2021

filling in another alternate panel
---and the printer panels
the warp tray is accelerated by using compensation and then film fuselaging twice
this forms a reactive vibratory layer (freq layer nestled in freq layers that boil)
they boild over and cause a field that can be manipulated with algorithmic pickups
this requires a zyntheium gpu however (4x card---or master spy tray too)
our death clawed angel viel is the only safety in works in corpulent lighting, for our pilots are fully automated for it
using a centrifugal mod pack (and also a logi-mac for the warp field)
by using thiccware (combined anti-pod emplacements it can set points in lockdown)
it can also open rifts for construction efforts in isolation
due to its prevalence in the use of raid braining
it uses the discahrge it creates as a rift device to use anti pods (by drop lines)
allowing it to maintain path during construction (otherwise would bee blast-chartered)
once a rift is summoned and the station is channeled it is considered at stationary
which mean it can summon full battle -lodging auxilliarry and colonizer capital ships
--
which essentially means a full base deploy and a full station with field control stat
that is readilby chargable and readily shielded
while even in stealth can just cocur through its command in remote application too
via full gounds draft teleportation
this is also "prostheticized with an assistant relay ban d" (accessibility)
this protects against minicluster leaks or any other leak that could occur in lock
allowing for full lock clearence or also phase shifting
a phase shifting is like a diplomatic immunity that is weaponized
--
is allows for discharge to be mitigted by the propulsion in which it can phase shift
using also a blast shield to reduce the phase shift during a locked raid
it can therefore fetch or retrieve from within the raid lock as necessary
as well as recon or actually construction via raid rifting
dependant on thiccware windows was a mainsite
it maybe on a cooldown due to nuclear exhaust (exhaustions are from overhaul)
can also use rift macros with enough discahrge to generate multitarget MarkZones
these multi-rifts are spread and distributed thru its own drone cloud (or antipod)
mote antipodal drone launching is used with a cloud being marked as its own riftlock
therefore the rift lock can occur as or within a wizlock or in a secured containment
(it basically oes everything a regular multi-build could achieve in one move)
autometon can be therefore deployed and activated to occur renmote mining and rig site (site-in)
automated exoskeleton can be deployed and activated for renmote mining on rig
however requires zynthium shard tracting (or a zynthium tunnel)
harvesting locked resources for elementium with minuimal diminished returns however
they are iterated as quarantine anamolous nft packs or quos
they are decoded in the virtual tray then handled as anamolous containers
then via nft (actuation) by refitting on a zynthium reactor skate (kernalization)
as for prismatic zynthium which we balance back to the warp tray and the entire rig
prismatic zyntheium stabilizes warp and void borders and red-zone usages
allowing us use of the server crest and brand for ourselves
---
via trademark and stock restoratives
trade marking is an intel placement and restoratives are supply injection
we are going to use it as a modulator
--for fishing our resourcing from our baitline (over resourcing pools/livestock)
basicalyl a fully moded rig that casts out a reel

*cue harassment

so anyway it fractalizes like i was gonna say except its in a royalty of security
this essentially creates isolated podding for which are colonized encampments
these isolated encampments are only accesible through crypto-fielding vr-k use
but can be ported in and out where locks are availible for vr-k residualities
this is known as IPRS-socketting and/or proxy-IPRS emplacement (plugin and extension use can be applied here if also wanted)--(port socketing assignments and designations)--through which info/intel may also be injected
depending on the intel it can be locked or qausi locked or basically unlocked over (or set to a quasi-mode /plotter)
helps to allow occipital briding which helps secure travel between access routes (over a semi-conduit connection/tesla)
allows for synthetic cleansing of kernals as well using the warp thru corruptives
a micro kernal we can replace corruptives with synthetic protection (inline-seal)
but have to infuse with elementium which dilutes and can cause structural issues
so its best ot do it once and consider it with the computational effort that it lasts
---
course its potency wears off too as does the computational benefit but it remains (of imprint possibly too)
and protects it from corruption 
using zsynth charging it can be overclocked (and restoratively overclocked as well)
using a blast casing with the temporal enhancement it can be sustained)
(this allows persistance thru damage or kickbacks or knockbacks or stuns)
this allows for zshield regeneration cylindrical-zytheium shard base (gpu-id)
also known as hyperstable (literally a space-kennel or domicile for a serverbase)
or the hyper poco as it was once referred as a poco
it exists also as a security scan for a mainsite expo (so expo security dispatch)
as a recon that acts as a pre-gate that handles a second layer or arrival-check
all traffic is therefore sent to the security poco and then to the expo launch site
which is considered as an automated lock and checking station for entry to gateway
--
then the gateway is passed or breached (if criminal access) and is notified to the capital (sec/services/alert/defensegrid)
as your standard raid brain would make coverage of // and allow for range-scanning of (against attacks over covenant/estate etc)
and then the gateway also therefore is a locked tunnel access between shard-use
so that is how zyntheium tunneling works (a shielded hyperspace)
thats heavily guarded and often times ocnsidered a lock space with (nematic macro)
having a lockspace all entry that is unverified is in a phase shift of being nematic
---
that means they are drained to incapacitation
and then booted quickly from the area via source keeping (source wardens)--relocations/incarnation
this is all done in occipital range until an incursion is notified and capital is alerted
then capital is arrived through their gateway proceedings
the synsthetic networking is recahrged also via auxilliary in this way (rate-watch)
this is prior to self destruction is ensured it uses nematic relay (enhanced) feint
where the area is power drained prior to meltdown
and it sent to the gpuid for recalibration which (while almost instantaneous) is bank
then power banks ocrrealate the data and power to priority sites for defense
this occurs as a region pulse as well for ease of access (in hi state production)
their chains are reinforced in the way that are also defensible in figure (or crime)
that allows for protective evacuation or fugitive control
hence the intel and tackling (injectives) merging to their expo-level range
set to a security post and the security post can be a tote
as mentioned with our dar-k-wraiths
the darkwraiths can tote where necessary for their version of (siege modes)
dark wraiths deploy full area proximity to reach void space where fleets cannot
by use of a gpuid tote
when then utilize nuclear cryptid
full models consist of awakened darkwraiths (enhanced and automated)
source keeping originally at t12 can probably be upwards of t64 or form 1-64(128)
the fuel sourcing and source keeping is therefore very strong at upwards of 256
---
but we consider it compact by c omposite issues to be 128 tops
with all of each being reinforceable or with assistances or wards or even fleets
so they are like warcraftian of having strongs and bosses and bosspacks etc raid
this also develops in bio-tech as a sort of "problem"
where source generation can be considered a hostile portal (or an eruption)
eruptions become infested and have anamolous elementium which is contagious etc (stratagemic collapse)
this is know as a soul rot (takes effect over quadratic iterations mostly--sometimes quasi)
a dark wraith can incur soul rot as an attack vessel or poisonous conduit
the worse and often enough to incapacitate any intruder (as is done so incursively)
we then stack soul rot against the protective synthetics in lattice or mac-works
zyntheium fusion core then provides for main site power
this uses amalgamate receptacles and isolated mea culpetic in ascertaining kernals
elementium clerical stand and thats what protects most of the occifies from the raid brain (bridling and general discarded eviscerra)----massively corruptive and contaminatable fallout and dis-vieling (can also incur corruptive uniformity in which corruption is resourced/persistance on impact site (rupture evidence)--(server corruption)
the server closets are locked and portected via security offices in their ex-pocos and quarantined against incursion this way if it does become a threat/obvious concern (if not too late anyway)---causes corruptive-wellsprings as well that should be focally-refreshed barring further corruption once contained/supressed

just able to predict yggbombs before they occur (due to it being a nucleartulpetic)
underwater desert yay yay (anamoly discovered) 6000, 100, -9149

above lightposting
atmos minera uses occipital ouphe (in its clash storm)
which act as a power draw for : its ultimate restorative (power bomb state)
this using ouphe awakening which causes a full system crash of any raid site (wishful thinking)
the clash storm requires protection of the ouphe awakening that causes a system crash
this is preventable by causing obstruction to the power draws using top sets (top headers /surface controls)
will delay the power draws enough to regain mobility and status effects to combat
then atmos minera must be supressed to stop the count down to its awakening
if done so correctly will prevent a rig shutdown or site destruction (safe-de-construction of an active dday site)
and prevent the atmos tulpetic (the ouphe esper) from being realized
the ouphe tulpetic esper can terrogorm the entire region regardless and is final (forced-conversion of local/native meta/ambience etc)
prominence is otherwise conflucted due to the atmos-minera summoning its keeper
---
the keeper will prevent prominence
and prevent the return of the promised day (evidenced in promisuary)
the promised day is the return of the emogea (prior to becoming corrupt)---this changed in other version to other hybrids
the emogae is basically the reealized homunculus of the spiritual kindred (ulralux or whatever)/per faction

*harassment ensues

the inejction with the intel can stun the entire a.i. scripting of the enemy target
so we use fractal terroforming to prevent the ouphe from awakening offrange (because that can happen)
(FractalCrest and Off-site Survey Systems)
--
multifractal attacks are therfore done thru specific proxyworks
thermite yggbomb
with the diodal staff as the igniter
this would allow for a specificator (or console culptic portable conduit) to handle inputs (auto debug soon)
in such that prominence inputs can be used where necessary
the ouphe reaches a climatic stage where in terraform performs a relm reset that corrupts
corrupt levels must be maintained to a stabilized level (this is a big deal requiring drones)---(staved adjustments in relm protocol/posting)
with the thermite nuclear fuel we create a minera ouphe (capable of achieve homeostatic aura)--firmware adjusts
the terminite emissions are coutneracted by aether emissions from the forge
but the fuel emission coupled with the nuclear thermite will make for a caustic exhaust
micro emissions can help to destabilize the caustic exhaust and dissapate
--
via multi-tracing
this causes the burnout of the dissapate which is a clear gas (or ozone) +heatsignatures
this allows for shine filters (simulated shine yields)
through the snuff-and-dust or whatever coupling to the filter and filler for exhausts
this can be done witha  steam stack so we use a basic steam stack, advanced, and isometric
this may or may not effect synthetic builds
because the build up will return
---
the build up against the synthetic
this creates the intel theraform (or of the like) highly primal hive obelisk
--
the quad systems prior are checked and double set in case
for the theraform waste bins on elementium
this is as well as the encoating that takes place of the (expulsion or rupture in filament res)
--
im having trouble nailing it down because there are like 4x4 quads backing up it being done so----
--
i already written them out but the also strange coupling of them going on is important
also the buildup and synthetic too
not to mention the ouphe tulpetic is basically mother ship in human form
and the controversy surrounding this is likely unarrived at this moment but there are layers
the multi tracing goes through the bevel and micro stage (with countours and membranes)
this means bump mapping
the bumps are node points in quantum vector
they are linked, they are barrel linked, hyperlinked, break-puck linked (forms a crosslink)
hits an Smoss board that is also a multiboard for gpuid and is doublebridge linked for OVRCLK
use of the autovamp and auto-embossing also is enhanced with the ouphe tulpetic (no reason)
the stuff breaks down from there and stabilizes and dissapates as it was told but meets fields
all the diodal thermiting creates a field too
this creates a venomized or weaponized serum used in the also gene splicing
----
the sequences that are modulated occur and the vbenom is prismaticized
this reinforces switchstancing with toplane-cornerbasing which is new and meets with brakes
the nuclear aligned tulpetic exo skeleton is then powerhoused
the micro is then used in the venom splicing
this fuels the glo-logics (the chemistrated extraneous logics)
this creates true elastic viscosisty in the chemistrat compound
this slowly consitutents as fuel usage in nitro level for goal-posting in thiccwares
this allows for minera to use as synthetic chemistrating (or its own fuel)
or safely exhume nuclear waste material as its own energy supply
this allows the ouphe to create its own shield usages against tulpetic fields and anti-traversal
allowing it to shadow walk between relms or (punctuate / shadowpost)
it can still be contained via safety vaulting in a tesla field

10/21/2021
these form the eucharoquest--(or a quo that is licoraqued and then smooths and then aura)
this supplies work to the dire sec + chiro sergal (model) that uses rift+siege+comp+synth (sonar based flyer type too...first version of the warbatz)
its immensely powerful more powerful than the t17 basically its a t18 --basically double crisps (double controls)
---
we call it the handicap prosthetic too of the crisps running as heraldric-decor(royalty/viscount ranking)
it tapers and segments
uses the logic glow as a signal to its phase shifts
like an electrode to its receptor (this can be controleld via induced moodswings/tantrums)
using downswelling + prismatic feedtray (system warm up optic) + (what other two things)
probly just a micro volt and a microwave
this occurs in dissapation so there may be loose ends (but electrode and pixel crts)
to form the haleo-crest aura
because of the trinomic-particle and its quasi-state being realized
our tulpetic trinomic hybrid chimera therefore crackles with energy
it is basically referenced as a collusus or large minera (avi-mech feral) (probably basilisk---autovoxable)
kitsune basisilx
like a sieker-amaratsu
it is due to the kindred merge
uses the "prim"-venom to encoat it sfield in range-boost
allows for the trinomial exoskeletons more pronounced use for the kindred mech minera issue
evidence by a "compression field"
while it is in stealth the area is in a condensed pressure when it is active there is electircity
this works with the chemistrats rteaching full synthesis
--
this has alot to do with th hive blossoms that occur
and able to lay (drone mines) for itself
--
they later hatch into spider lings
the exoskeleton is then gilden in prominencse which absorbs per faction saving throws against --(RENDER SAMPLING at-to/attentions--like a controlnet lol idk)
so we have a gilded exo skeleton (that is like poison-protection)
it can also be spiked but theres that--(ploss and latency)
allowing for a primal gilded exoskeleton (which is simply the plated armor or dragonscale)
its embossed automatically and its faction based automatically *(so it is soulbound)
user chooses to wear it or not if their soul is corrupt it cleanses it (and choice is restored)
this is incredible useful raid walking
with the segmenting and tapering of the dargon scale we can use nft plc in hiveblossom bud
which allows for prismatic budding
the prismatic budding is harvested in rainbowscale
(similat to rainbow blading)---maybe chaemeleon effects
it 'enhances' the logi-glow-macros
this also reinforces the range based network and field for the mine usage (auto detections)
the nft plc transmit back to the termina x console (dark-emerald power)
all dark emeralds from the prism bridge
this allows for elastic symbiotic control
which is very useful for detachable and inventorialized cargo storage of kindred model bases
also allows for soulbound trade prompts between prim user states
this however occurs on zyntheium server shards
it can also be defused or dilluted depending on its material bases and repair dragonscale
dragon scale is one step above zyntheium elementium
it can also effectively cleanse crisp corrosion
----
which occurs via corruption of kernals even with protection during heavy load or overclock
otherwise it is used as a weaponized material
in forging bladetech and adjusted biotech-steel (and dragon plating) with minera modulations
allow for deathclaw minera which is comprabable to atmos minera and also its tulpetic counter
it can easily shadow walk through active raids including core-shelters (whic are phylactery)
the phylactery exists as well as an elite-ender-plate in the draogn raid (where nucleus is)
so we can track capture and attemptively supress nucleic raid zones
this is the 'elite' level of the dragon stage or the hardcore raid mode of the dragon set
---
and basically is required that full dragonplate be used alongside vehicular ship assists
this is consdiered a cosmic stage setting in case of insurability (there really isnt much)
but auto raiding an elite hardcore class stage such as the eliteENDERDRAGON yields results
gilded suite can manipulate full terroform on site
the broadcasted arrays help immensely in doing this especially since the emboss+etcx combo
