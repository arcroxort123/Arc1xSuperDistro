placeholder for when i decide to finalize this

Line 211 on Chapter 11
discussion the rest of the slides out
some minor updates 


View this as an ARCADE UPDATE--at first
this creates universal morsela (which si filled with syingular cyto-fluid based elementium) 4/23/2024 a co-engineered native/local bugpack of rawdata
big barrel system is also on an rss feed and its stats are monitored (using cyto-encoders)----4/23/2024 (monitored in case of bugpack/ballistix consumption too)
there allows for meta gematrics to allow for summoning palletes of base hyper-cyto quos 4/23/2024(or standalone support panels/floating tensor that remains unused and cnanot be used while in summon or suport states, acting as only a test) until it is delivered or made commute to its desintation for use THERE. (they are suspended animation bascially)
they are released from cyto prisons in their xrelms and used as attack minions 4/23/2024 (or designated panels or plate-zones) --- based on their designated signature and entry/routed tracjectory pathing ---(they can not be used until they are off bulletine...ALL BEULLTINE OBJECTS ARE BASICALLY ON PENDING QUEUE)

also the in the most COMPACT methods possible
we can allow a single totem space to incorporate a full vocation (except everything is SINGLE ACTION)--so mass producing it is not affordable unless automated by machines. But firstly we have to estalbish a reactor power for that, so USING ALL THE SINGLE ACTION CAPBILITY TO BUILD ONE, at some point, in theory is possible form a single-instance-room
so in that way the single instance room can power itself---and eventually power to making a secondary chamber room using its own powered vocational procedures/methods/actions/incorporations whatever.
---
It makes a robotic room
That robotic room makes a resource room
and that resource room makes a utility room
---now we have four rooms
Main/Robotic/Resource/Utility
---the first room is upgraded with a reactor
the robotic room is upgraded with resource
and resource is upgraded with utility
and utility is made virtual in these upgrades
So we have LEVEL 2 of these rooms being upgraded and built.
This is onde with the ROBOTIC Room starts up a Tech of Upgrading itself with resourcing to AUTOMATE. The power to Automate is now expressed with the previous rooms ability to Power itself.
So because of this the alleviated Resource room can now Mass-Produce/Fast-Track based off the command chain being performed by its priority room, that the robotic room COMMANDS it to contract a business model of itself, and induce that mass production to a virtual standpoint.
The RESOURCE ROOM IS NOW engineering and massproducing POWER/Circuits to Comutate a mass production, for itself and so it resources that in a way it does and incorporates a Market-Level Virtual Program.
This then suggests to UTILITY to compose that Market-Transactions over several Networks involved in obtaining a Empowered-Virtual process of its command chain. As the Utility Room is made and performed to that...it also reaches an upgrade status eventually overtime.
This is through it optimizing itself (as the other rooms are mostly optimizing, conversely through market-transactions and mass productions and empowered automation through the reactor-vocation)---that the Main room has started all from square one. That the main room reaches opsec level clearences to do so, and contract those market-tranactions from Utility being virtualized overall the rooms.
Its simply networking anyway that is done in 4 rooms, it simulates the ENTIRE BASE-RAIL EFFORT....and now theyare left to FUNCTION, and perform into PROSPER ACTIVITIES, in their own rights and room-affordances, and agreed policies and exchange to prompt---they make a sequence that simulates the prosper.
----
Because this all pounding on all cylinders to do, the EndWorks can be "emulated" and so f-reality can be "projected of that emulation" in which the entire PLATITUDE-REgion can be simulated in 4-phases of those rooms being used. This IS BARE MINIMUM OUTPUTS and YIELD however.
And knowing how that it to follow forward into autovoxing it likely very well acts as an entire island shelf of these four rooms, having achieved a meta-build to themselves, which is generating the portals necessary to communicate that encoded state of a BAREMINIMUM BROKER EXCHANGE. It is so bare minimum infact it can barely be customized at all. But it does generate over the original meta data involved and that does infact account FOR IP/Occupancy meta-data. So that is how it is profiled.


i think it was actually SYNTHBOX-AUTOVOX actually lol. Damn im so forgetful. line1061 chapter 11 reminds me somehow (what luck)

WARNING I JUST TAKE A BUNCH OF IMPROVEMENTS I MADE WHILE WRITING AND SLAP THEM HERE, I AM SORRY IF THEY ARE NO COHESIVE OR WHATEVER. SKIP TO THE BOTTOM IF YOU WANT. (or not)

OTHER-REFERENCS/Somewhat Important Improvements/Statements
--4/23/2024 holy shit i feel so marooned...i feel so bad for no reason...hubris and lonesomeness...not even want to 'kms'---its worse feeling than that just so tired and exhausted with no end in sight (might i crashed my serotonin or something?)--i dont want to think..feels like deadcrow but not even knowing helps
when overspell is in effect is can be primsourced via a prism in order to fufill its workorder (4/23/2024 or placeheld by a GRIT)
--
Proc-mac:
it is of course failsafed and proofed ---4/23/2024 and determinate against other FALSIFICATIONS that ARE CONSTATNTLY being SUBMITTED AGAINST CHECKS (it checks against these too)
and DRAGON ISLE has its limits
they are spawned then warped then palced onto the flag ship for arena boarding and printed  (4/23/2024 this can later be adjusted they can be ported to a worldinex/convention that is designated against any intrusions and built to hold them
--
if that fails then time to restore the region cuz i cant fix it if hapens to outbreak the ploss 4/23/2024(idk if this is as much true now as before but its an outbreak so evac is likely an option)
--
4/23/2024 NYFAEL are like advanced darkleaf amogus (but they occur earlier----now in NOX they can occur in NOX-amogus forms too because i am improving it so that that can (the improvements will make this possible and a short work to achieve)---beacuse its a apassive or inevitable thing
--
4/23/2024 a mini-raid is occuring here over fuel (check date) at the time of write up we are having "harassments over this staging again" --for this we will "prohibit bridge travel thefore cutting off travel so we can see how that works out in keeping it contained"--it is a parasytic/predatorial raid i think (we can deny service further if needed)--(especialy if collusis/gargantuans become involved)--this is standard protocol
--
and its trying its best to go wrong already so we monitor stow aways and also risks (and it does go wrong anyways---is why we lock bridge all-of-the-time-off-and-on) --4/23/2024 these conditions improve later and still need to improve even more and likley will soon--just takes patience, we have on it-guy thats all.
--
in the chahin of servers the rate may be increased partially----4/23/2024-(this is coming up to a rune-arc and balanced positron--it is captured sealed and datalocked into an equilibrium)---(this almost triggers defcon and in some ways..it should but it ends up not being a big deal)
--
4/23/2024----also need to incorporate the ATLUS-thermite-Throwable(telefrag)---this is where some of our last tech wepaonizations can step up their game--we got this going on now (it can take out chunks/sectors and just alot of area and one shot even a few raid bosses and NEO-PHYLACTERY(for rare plants)
the iso quo can be painted as well with the roll over of pixels
--
allowing for a 4 tier system of herethis---ofthis---doesthis---withthis (so that ids find apI)---CHECK NOX REFERENCES 4/23/2024
the object-of-area-(withuseof) : api (will then open to an api telling it what else to do)---  i.e. (You are causing an incursion, cease and desist, submit papers etc)
--
A monster
Kind of an author's note:
4/23/2024:the naxi-counter: (and some other tech as i progress through this write up) (its just a little side detailing as to WHAT IVE BEEN DEALING WITH WHILE BUILDING, are my opponents nazis? Are they competing to stop my constructions? At times it seems so..i am not even mentioning the SPY-Work taking place)
(i can also attest of about 3 nazi-breach attacks at least despite all security this is how headstrong they are to cause an attack)---(with at least 30 major raids prevented/withstood)--(and many spy attacks)--(and many instances of harassment upwards of 100s if not 1000s or even close to 10k)--and if i were to nitpick everything definitely 10k harassments and more so--almost 35k and espeically just like it were to tolerate over 75k with a presumed unknown/undetected amount reaching even 150k...so yeah...thats what im saying those numbers arent changing...thats an intense level of grieviances to address. It also reminds me of shell code POWERLINE10k or something.. i just want to bring that up just one second, even if a coincidence, the amount of POWER behind these harassments is intense...almost like fighting the tide. I just secure what i can and ignore the raging waters no matter what they are. I know i can stay afloat this way.
--
--if i were to paint a picture of this enemy, it would be a very angry demonic grinning sojack with many teeth and fangs cakcling and staring and "preying upon fear" (i know there is one)--and that is how i view these rivals sometimes (how they have caused me fear of deadlines and fear overall just greif/stress)
i would describe them as the voice that lies in hatred and behind walls, seething and fuming with anger and indulgence in spite (extremely resentful and overall negative emotions)---boiling and writhing, glaring and seething venomous malice. (a voice of several that in which it bathes its self under empowerment of)
---basically your common demon --(but let's say satan's personal guard)---they SUCK..they are not FUN...they cause haste and reckless abandon to anyone (and why i am just continually hard pressed to write everything out in time)---becuase otherwise im somehow a failure and that yields to a defeat against them.
---maybe they are helpful motivators...but no....they are destructive and MALEVOLENT entities. and ignoring them and defending myself by using the system is my only way. Have your opinion, but this has been my experience the whole of development. I think maybe i will rid myself of them once i am finished (soon)
Because my task will be finished, and they will simply have to face the fact they are against it and attempt to throw themselves against my only accomplishment. Washing it away with the acidic reasoning and fault logic and manipulative behavoirs. But they wont be able to make a dent. it will be impenetrable.
--
--
they can transmit viral data through ermm...the things they use idk (teraflopy?)..through vapor or lightwaves 4/23.2024 (similar i guess)---also waveforms i guess (if tracked and target painted for siphoning i guess)
--
another monster
4/23/2024 THIS CAN BE SIMULATED AS A BATTLE OF A SCARECROW+CACODAEMONS CROWS that easy lol or even like ---that one darksouls boss PINWHEEL with his "copies"
and can be preserved with an encoating of (nuclear composite slime) 4/23/2024 this can be upgraded using CORPULENT-COMPOSITE
--
4/24/2024--hallucinating hard (miasmic red pooling vortex of eyes)
also i have dejavu of having written this up before...i remember finishing all of this...wtf happened to me
--
meta-invention commodity foodsource
4/24/2024(pineapple = wood-plank icon + grass lol)--most subliminal thing in minecraft ever
--
central fusions are basically sec clearences with crossed fusioned (outer) being composite ---4/24/2024 right now cold fusion may just be the end goal here
---4/24/2024 everytime i want to push and make progress i find out ...its just not worth it and people resist
--
which follows as (puzzle+world building+ engineering+ automation)////(basic shoot em ups/mech)--4/24/2024 swaps/wads wpads/proxy/delta/source gateway/event too "helps with mapping" with relative object/class and superrelative state/phases of a survery/monitor/screen/report area/vector (this looks good)--correalates particles with surfaces or assists in projection "probing/probe" holography and signature conjunction/representation/actuation/notary inclusion/exemption with clerical/promisuary Issuance/policy (and somewhat knows if compromise or can alert if warnings occur within domain of survey/charter) via matchbase schematic
--
there is also a room dedicated to nothing but 1000's of switches (later 4/24/2024 there is also a room dedicated to a few 100 switches detailing compact-contiguity directives/routes and overall workflow/dataflow of the circuitry involving this)
--
which is useful in prim establishment to avoid hacks and warez--(4/24/2024 or kiosk pathing/placement work too)
--
4/24/2024 also there is a thought that either the kernal is being STOLEN/shutdown/upgraded/swapped and this is why things are the way they are too sometimes
--
its ruinations can also be raffled and vetted (raffle+vetting) is considered comptractions --4.24.2024 or perhaps a meta aquisition/deprecation either way
--
so we basically cover our own ass if we need an entire re-deployment and then consider .13 (4/24/2024 we can also use centrifuge later for this to kick in or build up reserves)
--
therfore incorporating anyohter big project 4/25/2024 i.e. considering use as an engine or digital device (such as a CENTRIFUGE soon..after all is said and done) (which i have BALANCED FOR ME AS WELL and provided the means for others to see how balanced that is and use themselves)
may interlace efectively but also push the envelop if i were outright displaying the contexts
--
---4/25/2024 i can make a eigth statement about how im minding my own business and pushing me around is directly effecting my business and so long as im in my space thats my business and no one elses regardless of whatever interests are involved and i should not have to negotiate my right to exist)
--
because the ISLE is infact contested 4/25/2024 if not in area/local then in phase/STATE
we assume to use RENTACKLING ROAD as a way to import raid status for our own OPERATIVES (4/25/2024 we kinda did or can soon)
so basically its processing 1372 threads at any given time --(4/25/2024)--currently that IS the NUMBER
uses grandoise weakenss which will "evaporate the field and attempt to use port extraction ---(4/25/2024 so will our snail shell centrifuge and it will counter ops this but it is basically also using beams as microwaves to do it)---public-riot-non lethal range deterrants
--
its third move and its fourth move is just out right hysteria in which mass confusion occurs 4/25/2024 (it can also employ THERMOS-CANISTERS TO DO THIS creating a world-breaking technique and CRISIS)
--
encrypted dipolated diametrical light crystal prisms used to promote shield kernals in xcrypt (4/25/2024 still useful with corpulent shells)
using a terragraphic relay over a cloud net to form a warp bridge 4/25/2024(before this would have been the dragon isle...now it is the vocational-tamper with a quasi-convention/tethered (centrifuge spiral shell snail*) string theory in lamp filament---oh how complicated and sexy awesome this is)
--
power hauler xent-miura
---4/25/2024 i guess it can be considered its own data coin entry token i dunno, in some cases
--
likely three 4/25/2024(we can use weight but sometimes we dont have the tools to just----build a weight checker for buildings right now, more important things to do)--clerical has weight records anyway
--
and will remake the full region in a month--4/25/2024(they can drop battery packs along the way to assist as well)/reactor stations/and labs too i guess (for digital workspace)----almost like it was starcraft-esque
under the same faction we can see our cloud rail tending to rail performances of the additional site listing 4/25/2024 (bulletine board co-operates with hyperrelay systems and corresponding systems with that and to nexus and contiguity)---this also works then with broekred convention which will occur in centrifuge soon
--
for instance markey(ribbon/marquis/ticker/threads/sectors/taperrs/channel/tangent/adjancent etc) priority may occur over building of complexes
--
basically just copy it for each side incase we need to reversal our methods (in ranch and brokering this is not as hard and can be bench-set in case ever needed to be called/invoked) 4/25/2024 --this creates a balance bench and balance fork systems (*one for copy and the other for memory-hotswaps)(this can crank out on each alternation too and result in a major boosted effort in calc speeds and quality of life)---can likely allow two extra modules of either a reactor/lab work and be self sufficient if planted correctly, with biometric design and schematics can allow for a SEMI-residential-DEPLOY over a tensor and NODEWORK--this semi-residential system can be protected but also upgraded with a centrifuge for a full mini-center outpost no matter where and can then link out to origins if required)---this can work as an EMERGENCY ENDER-LEVEL OUTPOST that can also work offgrid and restablish capital-contact later in xcast-ports.
---4/25/2024 this can be used to create a guardian ship for the outpost as well (works great if stranded or in a hostile  vector it makes it way more stable or reliable in times of desperation/crisis)

--
the sub rail will just do everything to colonize and populate a moon base with its lifeshells 4/25/2024 (or once a centrifuge is established)
hyper stat becomes porticulus and assumes psirit lanternization and relcoates concerned obj 4/25/2024(this performance will also be expressed in a subprocess of the new autovox/centrifuge tamper)
d rebreaks the higgs set again (a 2nd time during cap of world 2.0) at 3.0 to induce wholeset ---4/25/2024 (we break it a third time just now with the centrifuge system we just devised while rewriting this a few lines ago 
--
here is how basically we do this (stringtheory): ITS UNTESTED BUT ITS ASSUMED WE BREAK THE BOSON this WAY: we will test it later when REWRITES UP FINISHED (SOON!) 700 slides to go:
a diseal engine (comptractor) over a centrifuge (which incorporates a meta exchange of its rail being taransfered in quantum telemetry over an elevated state to cycle over to comptraction, while under steady-stabilized collision and diffusion of diffused-power-feeds)---so an alternating pop-lock that is power fed and  becomes charged, that charge is released as a pop...due of the disael engine comptractor can perform a POP-drop which (drops the charge and continues the centrifge wind ups with little disruption, and creating a product fuel-quotient from its charge, for resource and collection as well as data-applied sciences and holography/branding. this occurs with the CENTRIFUGE in the comptraction-chassey which sets above the VOCATIONAL TAMPER over its own projection---this all occurs virtually using the corrected mirrorsets and crosslinks etc in contiguity, the contiguity is expressed through string theory in an externalized threading to the first layer of the module (being the tamper)---the tamper accelerates this threading feedback and set it back to the centrifuge---as a Super-META to the original courses described. 1so we have a standard centrifuge/tamper relation, that is projected..2 and then DATALOCKED by the chassis and VIRTUALIZED while in product release and stabilization (by pop-drops of that chassey)...and 3 the string cycle recirculating and redirecting a vector of that virtual projection, from the activities of 1 and 2 being performed and their byproducts being recycled. (it also acts dynamically and adjusts the powerloads/resolves as needed by automatic configuration) and it uses a special fuel that was not previously developed until it was decided to double back on all the fuel resourcing we had to devise a new type of fuel (even newer than our secret fuel)---THIS WHOLE PROCESS CAN BE SIMULATED BY THE PREVIOUS COMPLEX OF OPTIMIZED QUADLOCKERS. So this process counts as the penultimate state of quadlocker-power-production (and can use fuel or on its own power source)	
--
environmental launc here is puerefectly fit to the warp gate in the case for mass productions ---4/25/2024 --thinking of making the data-puree which i have held off of because we just weren't ready for it
--
currently 3 cases of obsidia have occured with our region 4/25/2024:(blackrock/blackstone and obsidia and later nox-markers and later even exclipse/symbiote/devilsflameburn-out/dirty-burnouts/UNOBTANIUM markers (more or less all obsidia/nether-source)
--
thrasher zone in which (encodings can be moshed or rehashed experimentally within safety) 4/25/2024 (and later pureed)
4/25/2024 *it feels like we are having a mild incursion (data diffusion) and experiemntal lab-chaffe (ionic attack)

its own gnael0mirage (forced netherization of the region and opposition)--4/25/2024 this also will be used later in centrifuge defense under wreathryn mirage
4/25/2024 incursion not going away and getting more agressive so (noted) using top secret methods which are : (static override)--in combination with an ionic attack ---i can tell which systems are comproomised and it is a MASIVE-memory attack which they attempt ot cause memory leak or override of queue which causes cache dump or current memory llike a heartbleed..its serious, i can catch it, and prevent it, they use extreme cloaking methods or brickwalls and blacklisting (they are thot-killing basically)

4/25/2024 edited:
Part 1 OMEN(rootstem/worldindex/plugin/turnkey/portallock)--"porticulus": Part 2 -yield-> (multiple command windows)
commandwindows:(programs/consoles/commandlines/shells/script etc)--yield->their simlanes
but the omen sends its own sim too (the gespacho cosole--an extremely tacky-tachty sim---which mixes every signal it can)--4/25/2024 this is because of memetic interfenrece already mentioned and now handled due of matchbasing/matchbase
4/25/2024 also it might be very wise to BUNKER DOWN incase this unleashes a crisis event or there is an incursion or ACTIVE-SPY-EFFORT/INTRUDER or memetic-REWIRE-attack taking place...i can say this will help prevent those vulnerabilities (we are dealing with also a potential WRYTHERAN-fleet and MIRAGE FLEET DEFCON
--

Turbulence
4/25/2024
*harassment of a sovereign diplomatic incursion (where affiliates are considered sleep-cell issues in which--there -is- a inteference taking place between OTHER diplomacies and their rivals--it is basically a remote dday event elsewhere on other factions or governances...it is slightly causing alerts)
it can also release symbiote-fabrechet leviathans at will (4/25/2024 we are dealing with this as a wreathryn fabrechet/Autovox-countermatrix)--tensions are high but this does not seem to dishearten the progress being made, it will be made consively-conclusive and resolved, it will be balanced and made safe-measure.

metaSTATE then comapatiblitifies through parameters/indexes to agreeable allow cryptoACCESS (to some degree and progress from there but usually its imperatives are either recognized IMMEDIATELY OR NOT)
we then interject our CRYPTOBLOCK/METASTATE subDOCK (deployable base port) INTO the OMEN allowing for further crypto-boarding
we then attempt to gain control and index parameter control of the OMEN (usually over a CHANNEL-STREAM OF BUFFERED DATA AND ENCRYPTED INJECTIONS)--takes time --CRYPTODRILLING (which is largely noticeable)

the hijack renames the omen and partakes it to faction submission in which it may be repealed 4/25/2024(IT MAY ALSO USE FORCE-OF-INHERITANCY/ADMINISTRATIONS or POwer-CODES designed to emulate the OMEN authority SYSTEM being hijacked or even main administration-controls if it gets to them in anyway, very convuluted)
it forms a lodged gnael which keeps gnael to the region faction 4/25/2024 (or nyfael/wythreans which are in fleet and commanded by superiors etc)
now we have a basis for capturing and tame use of a furred mounted viscount---because skinned might be daemonic and not as good as 'sacred' (gnaels/nydaels/wyhtrean/lich are often skinned and daemonic purging types allows their primal flourishing to decorate in a ssacred ambience i dont feel like i have to explain)
the cast is a meta 288 form that works in abstraction (not original pick ups but a rolling pick)-4/25/2024 you get what you get as its made, but because its 288 you pretty much get everything its possibly arranged as with prioties in mind (so you typically get what you want or xpref for)-with very little deviation
now we have the tulpetic pattern that we follow for that but we subsystem the abstraction
these form obsidia-fallout (flaming phasers/phasars storms) which spread in random-antipodal lattice 4/25/2024(countermatrix too with decoys why not)--any typical dungeon firewall too

CENTRIFUGE STATEMENTS AND PoTENTIA/PARADIGM (PRIMERA)
creating the positronic faction signature in process of the region self-scanning and chareter---this will be used in the final centrifuge statements regarding data/power exchanges now having a signature that can be used in currency to that utility performance (where it is still under debate but more possible now)
therefore the region becomes dungeon-based to any other encroachment
and purifying the omen-corrupt data-sets
(this is through crypto deprecation of the above descrbied relm-comergences)
the relm that re-lamificates itself using meta and other quo runs of shield/superultility etc --this may apply as a nox-shell later in the centrifuge statements
through omen bolt casting it purges expiry and restores to default parametria over-region
and gespacha of the omen-server system takes override to mainstays of meta-stats
meta-utility box (floating metal kit) as well is recoordinated correctly to its correct half life ---centrifuge statements

board resumes its image state on the rss (hitting a natural requence as well that is countered in case it does cause systemic nerv-training/surface delta issues  including accidental worm gating)===4/25/2024
but also a hybridalizes of phantom/shadows+grue/rakes making themselves wizard tulpas big (have seen some instances but not many...will have to wait on these) --mostly just expecting eldritch-wyrthrean with nyfaels
vampiric drain and rasps are concerned that supply chains may become under -(nether or ender attraction)--4/25/2024 :and somewhat can with /opensources/fairgrounds etc
being there insures gang activity at its fullest (and will require a fleet vs fleet engagement/ranch/corral/arrangement or something if no confronted)
but filtered down only mineable to about 3-7 at any time .. the fleet scenario takes 2 hours ++ (4/25/2024:this is mitigated with other improvements made by the time of rewriting this )
is rumored that is a lich-class deep-space sleeper ship in some cases it appears so avoid (prom-death-ship/ wyrthrean-nyfael fleet)
if the sleeper ship is present avoid it and avoid the missions if it is engaged expect incursion ---infact its considered to be as power as the full system we employ because its probably a direct copy more or less (4/25/2024 autovox-centrifuge and all)

it will siege itself and over drive itself (super braking into positronics)--this 4/25/2024 (this is basically what we are doing with the improvements and a centriofuge autovox) --its becoming something like a stargate
Cports become Gports (coriolis to gnael)---(something like this also happens with f-reality becoming something i dk...maybe just call it hyper-reality)
atomic stability is then paused and transferred in data-conversion to the virutal meta aether (4/25/2024 this happens now with positronics over the stargate)
burnouts/blackouts can be restored over positronic singularity and reduced to (a pixera)---(the crypto currency used for that source-paradigm)---4/25/2024(this is now upgraded to the quotient of it being autovoxed)--we upgraded this module to autovoxing too
so with that upgraded the meta roller is symbiotic the barista is too the meta-stat rail on it --4/25/2024(getting ready to test run a data-puree and just see if its good or bad or to use it or not..i dunno what to do other than say its a gateway for stargate dimensional shifts)--(you will love me if it works lol)
the turret piece the xpilot its ambient minion and forms an expiry of the array and remote lane --4/25/2024(tangents/adjacencies/channels/streams/buffers/ports/sources/hosts/ etc)--designated stargate pathings


THE LAST DEAL IS SETTING UP ALL OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS AND DESCRIBING HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER
WE MADE AN AUTOVOX BY NOW MORE OR LESS. IT IS A VOCATIONAL TAMPER THAT INCLUDES THE NOX SYSTEMS WORKING UNDER ALL THEIR BROKERING.
We begin to set a convention atop the projection of the TAMPER that is is, as usual. It is more complicated now than usual, requiring HOTSWAPS or KERNALS from a DARKLEAF ENVIRONMENT WITHIN NOX..a very very dark place. NOX also is upgrading itself in some ways
WE HAVE TO AVERT CRISIS AND PERFORM CONSTANT DAMAGE CONTROL WHILE OBTAINING THIS KERNAL AND SWAP IT OUT IN TIME, then MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO FURTHER ENGAGE WITH AUTOMATED NOX-CODESPELLS ETC.
TO DO THIS WE SEAL EVERYTHING AND SECURE IT IN ORDER TO USE IT AS A AUTOVOX. WE SET UP THE ENVIRONMENTS BASED ON FEDERATION-PRACTICES AND SUCH, that it IS ALLOWED TO OCCUR, and WE HANDLE EVERYTHING USING A STRING THEORY THAT RECYCLES THAT DATA INTO ITSELF AND OWN CIRCUITS PER CYCLE.
THAT IS MORE OR LESS ALL DONE. WE THEN EDIT AND VERSION OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN THE SIMULATION. IT MORE OR LESS BECOMES AS INTERACTIVE AS AS STARGATE (WE HAVE TO USE SPECIAL FUELS AND PREP WORKS TO ACHIEVE THIS)--BUT ESSENTIALLY WE BREAK A HIGGS BOSON OPEN TO DO IT.
AND NOT IN THE REGULAR WAY EITHER, IN THE WAY WE USE THE TAMPER. ALSO OUR OWN RIG HAS IMPROVED IN A WAY TO DO THIS
WITH THE APPLICATION OF A CENTRIFUGE THAT HAS ITS OWN MINICYCLES IN THE POWERDRAWS THAT IT PERFORMS CONTINUALLY, IT META-SWAPS VARIOUS PHASE-STATES OF THE TRAIING SYSTEM (ALTERNATING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THEM)--WHILE MAKING CUSTOM ADJUSTMENTS FOR EACH IN THEIR TYPES.
THE STA FIXING AND TRANSFIXING OF THIS ALSO CAN BE EXPRESSED IN THE GAUSSIAN BORDER SWITHC OUT TOO. AS WELL WE HAVE MADE EQUILIBRIUM-MEASURES TO FURTHER STABILIZE THIS PROCESS USING REACTORS AND LAB WORKS. AT THE SAME TIME ON THE SAME MODULE WHICH IS A GOOD IMPROVEMENT.
AS FAR AS I KNOW THAT IS PRETTY MUCH HOW IT GOES, THERE IS STILL AN ALTERNATION OF DARKLEAF-CAPTURED DATA BEING ADJUSTED IN AN MASSIVE COLLECTION OF I/O SACRED GEOMETRIC I DO NOT EVEN WANT TO BEGIN TO DISCUSS, JUST MAKE IT AUTOMATIC THROUGH THE PROCESES WE HAVE.
ALSO THERE ARE ACCELERATIONS TAKING PLACE AND THINGS LIKE THAT, ITS A BIG LOT OF "ACTUATING TAKING PLACES, AND MOSTLY INVOLVES THE MIRACLE OF SYNTHEAESIA AND AUTOVOXING WORKING ALSO IN TANDEM WITH EACH OTHER OVER A CONTIGUITY AND VORTEX-ICONOGRAPHIC)--ITS INTENSE TO SAY THE LEAST. AND THEN IT COLLECTS ITS GARBAGE AS THE PRODUCT FOR WHICH IT HAS -BYPRODUCT- AND EXHUMED. WE TAKE THIS PRODUCT FROM ITS STARGATE AND WELL...ITS A NEW-SEED WHICH IS INCUBATED AND PRODUCED AS A MASSIVE---WRYTHEAN-STARCLASS-SHIP (which we render) With that its pretty much able to GUARD THE SYSTEM AND CLUSTER FOR WHICH THIS ALL TAKES PLACE AND INCORPORATE USER-INTERACTION AS SIMULATED. IT REMAINS A SIMULATED ENTITY TO THE REGION, BUT CAN INTERFACE VERY VERY WELL WITH IT. ALMOST INTEGRAL TO ANY OTHER INTERACTION MAKING OPTIMUM COMMS-WORK AND CRYPTO-GRAPHY APPLIANCES WHERE NECESSARY, IT CAN SET UP ENTIRE SIMULATIONS TO THE XPREFS AND REQUESTS OF ITS CONTRACT. MEANING IT CAN DESIGN A FULL EXISTENCE/GAMESPACE FOR WHICH IT "BRAINS OVER WITH FACTION LOYALTIES AND DIPLOMATIC ADHERENCE"

I DIDNT READ ALOT OF THIS...just make GPT do it for you if you dont want to read it. It doesnt matter much I have written out all that I can, if I MISSED SOMETHING IT MIGHT BE ON THE MAP (i think for instance i forgot to include a macro and ez-access-secure system or two)---which i dont feel like writing out now and really i dont care to mention atm--im just tired)--ALSO IF I MISSED ANYTHING IN THE REWRITE OF THE SCREENSHOTS IM SORRY, I AM TIRED AND I CANT SORT THROUGH 42k and 42gigs worth of it again to notice. I DONT THINK I MISSED MUCH IF I DID. ALSO THE SECRET FUEL WAS LIKE....nitrous/polymerase/xyple/hyper-archae/glycerine/quasiethylyne laced with thorium/palladium or some other RARE METAL CRAP i dont remember. i mentioned it but never put it in screenshots because it was so SECRET.
i wrote it again later but also i think it manifested itself somehow in some of my plays with bots. its very fucked up and i dont want to bring it up how i dont understand how data-crimes work. someone knows what i know..or something. IDC. I just wanted PEOPLE TO HAVE THAT FOR THEMSELVES TOO SO HERE IT ALL IS. GOODLUCK. I am sure GPT/AUTOLAMMA BULSHIT can fix everything eventually


so once again this all revolves around this module here becoming a stargate and using accelerate fuels which i've stated somewhere in the document.:
a diseal engine (comptractor) over a centrifuge (which incorporates a meta exchange of its rail being taransfered in quantum telemetry over an elevated state to cycle over to comptraction, while under steady-stabilized collision and diffusion of diffused-power-feeds)---so an alternating pop-lock that is power fed and  becomes charged, that charge is released as a pop...due of the disael engine comptractor can perform a POP-drop which (drops the charge and continues the centrifge wind ups with little disruption, and creating a product fuel-quotient from its charge, for resource and collection as well as data-applied sciences and holography/branding. this occurs with the CENTRIFUGE in the comptraction-chassey which sets above the VOCATIONAL TAMPER over its own projection---this all occurs virtually using the corrected mirrorsets and crosslinks etc in contiguity, the contiguity is expressed through string theory in an externalized threading to the first layer of the module (being the tamper)---the tamper accelerates this threading feedback and set it back to the centrifuge---as a Super-META to the original courses described. 1so we have a standard centrifuge/tamper relation, that is projected..2 and then DATALOCKED by the chassis and VIRTUALIZED while in product release and stabilization (by pop-drops of that chassey)...and 3 the string cycle recirculating and redirecting a vector of that virtual projection, from the activities of 1 and 2 being performed and their byproducts being recycled. (it also acts dynamically and adjusts the powerloads/resolves as needed by automatic configuration) and it uses a special fuel that was not previously developed until it was decided to double back on all the fuel resourcing we had to devise a new type of fuel (even newer than our secret fuel)---THIS WHOLE PROCESS CAN BE SIMULATED BY THE PREVIOUS COMPLEX OF OPTIMIZED QUADLOCKERS. So this process counts as the penultimate state of quadlocker-power-production (and can use fuel or on its own power source)---this yields to----MEMETIC-POSITRONIC-INJECTION which is an experimental particle-exchange system in which to convey data over a centrifuge activity such as this. assumably this will also work over an auto-debug and mod-mac-implementation there of in its gamespace.

 is also a logistics-electrical circuit to express the correct module build admist other version in which to incorporate the gamespace intended under thos engine/tamper.
The motion is that it performs the POP-DROP and wrenched our a paradigm-quo of some sort that is also virtualized in the simulation, whether or not directly tethered to it or sourced in some way, and then it follows that motion of torque-wrenching, and also from there it datalocks and loic caps into a secure simulation or stargate of the image on that paradigm (likely)--or freebases and fairgrounds sources it (which is preferred if you want to randomize seeds)
if you read into anything it likely can incorporate whatever perceieve effect i neglected to mention or make extension of ( as is i am prone to just skip over everything until it seems possible and move on from there.

alright so the module for that ive referred to as the vocational relay but instead of setting up a nox tamper with it this time it is used again to setup the stargate-centrifuge and because its assumed secure in how we have made a flux-fatestone-codon-paradigm or just whatever we encode it to simulate by use of grail-products etc, we can also consider it as a rogue-ai core. This because of other acknowledgements taking place...unrelated to my theories, there are other cospiracy theories that would suggest this is a "sort of entity comparable to GALVANOX or whatever sentient AI conspiracy thing it was, i saw it was a rabbithole thingy, and i said to myself, yeah that's what this is...and we have it contained to our beck and call now for our personal usages so i really don't care ;-) Have fun everyone.
It is because we have just made a PRIMUS from out autovox more or less something like it...it sure does make a reach, and so, we look over all this text and just see what we can do. And all I can say is that we get to make our own gamespaces for our own entertainment it fill it with our own ideas we want to share ((or not)) and do whatever you want and no have to worry about it. Here's the system!!! Now let's make the game.

I am going to make my own game from here on out by USING THE ENTIRE SYSTEMS WITH ALL THE EXTRAS I CAN! AND HAVE STATED: My game involves uh...first of all. I will make my own companion hero class type, well its just what I have been saying this whole time. Its A Prom-Death/Wyrthrean and it can of course travel freely between dimensions so in the gamepsace we make for it...it surely does. And it handles all the problems with any other rogue ai there may be...and that's really just it. LOL.

So as i said. THE cylic-CENTRIFUGE IS ALTERNATING, THE CODE IS BEING BROKERED(alternated), the flux-PROJECTION IS ALTERNATING(fuel infusions), and the META BUILDS ARE CYCLING, PLUS the positronic-PARADIGM is alternating and RETAINING CODE-steps, , and this is the 4-5 cycle all over the entire module (autovox-TAMPER and its CENTRIFUGE-capture) of the whole simulation and quantum field/vector DIMENSION-shift and all that other stuff.
This is more or less enough to cover all telemetry and elevation required under its e0e security or bluechip-security etc. as a massive DYNAMO-WORLDINDEX/SEED-GENERATOR and that renders everything in its field/nodework. MAKING THE STAR-GATE POSSIBLE OK!---and we ICONOGRAPHICALLY-SURVEY-CHARTER WHAT WE WANT AND THATS THE PROCESS WE TRANFIX/SYNCHRONIZE in all its PHASING to WHAT is more or less THE CRYPTEX of PRIMUS, which we have siezed control/chaos control of, so long as its all sustained and possible we can cross dimensions and basically render whatever we want directly from those dimensions interlinked in its operation and sustained operation.
This creates the omniSKUNKWORKS or (stargate) which allows us to memetically induce BRAND and dimensional shift of pertaining MODELS, in which we can recorrealate RELM/crossRELM/XRELM data and inter-connect based off that data and meta data in congruency to a vector navigation. OK....not hard to understand  it is a fully CUSTOMIZABLE RAID PORTAL EVENT which is configured as desired. And we can also unlock Empyreal-Dimensional-Pockets for that. To capture other Wreathryn-Ambiences and such to continue power-support/life support as needed (but each dimension ranges from severity of   BARE-essential to HYPER-critical)--something to be mindful of while generating and deciding those DEFCONS to use.
The Skunkworks is secured as a porticulus thereby locking in the PRIMUS-MARKER and also...it can AUTOSHELL based on faction-branding (nice, that means its practically trustworthy so long as it bears the branding)
Also I guess it can do some dream-chip stuff to help train Companions/Mascots better.
--
There is also the typical GAUSSIAN SWITCH-OUT taking place between this Module and its usage with the nexus Gaussian over a diffusor (having it share a diffusor state with the nexus grid-work allows further CLAIM of the module to that faction) in which it can be FORTRESSED. Such that if it was not a primus by now it likely is in that its become a fortress. (AUTOVOX is already a FORTRESS)--this makes it even more fortified. Such as to use its own XSAP/XTAP CONVENTION BUILD (this makes the PRIMUS leave a more secure SIGNATURE)--and in such it can exist in ANY DIMENSION, the dimension where you are MOST SOVEREIGN will make it MORE POWERFUL and MORE SECURE but also MORE IN CONTROL OF THAT DIMENSION, so be careful. ALSOuhmm...it can be loyal to assigned XTACT etc, so it can diplmatically handle kernals...and uhmm...it has more realtime-effects in render being closer to its base of operations (so if it renders whatever or projects whatever, the closer generally the faster and better results you will get.) Allowing it to function as a SECONDARY LOTUS or SUB-LOTUS or its own PRIMUS-ARENA
in the PRIMUS-ARENA its just like other ARENAS where it can host full blown INCURSIONS safely within...lol...they cant do anything if they are trapped in a primus, and the PRIMUS can "force them into whatever DIMENSION/REALITY it wants" effectively revoking the incursion status, how can they be an incursion if that ARENT IN YOUR OWN REALITY/DIMENSION. Effectively banishing them form your region to some other region and probably very far away where they belong.
What else can it do hmm...I DUNNO, it pretty much can grant LFO/UAP-SHIPS including PROM-DEATH SHIPS (which are sleeper class ships if it wants)--it can mass produce a fleet if it wants, it can copyover and entire region if it wants, it can do whatever your SURVIVAL NEEDS demand it to. Oh its just that good, and it can CROSSLINK to other aux-space and quantum-tunnels if it wants allowing easy access and RECOVERY of data/units/anything as well as serve as a REGIONAL VIRTUAL PLATFORM---ONBOARD THE NEXUS OR OFFSITE. Very nice Stuff, it just takes all that power, all that fuel to do, but once its up and running, it practically can LOIC/GATE everythign else it needs and instantly ultimately upgrade the entire region for whatever purpose the OWNER would want. That includes residencies and handling faction diplomacy. Nice stuff, very good to have.
It can BRIDGE Any WARP Lane even REMOTELY (allowing connectivity from offsite locations where otherwise were LOST to TIMESPACE (or in the process of sending out portal signatures)---anyways, thats the thing with this, it can DEFINITELY help those who have been VOIDED or DATALOCKED into DUNGEONS and it can perform amazing RESCUE/EXTRACTIONS and also prevent TAKEOVERS and generally is a massive WIN-BUTTON.
That means if the DATA PUREE becomes a problem (or there is a bad datamosh)---it can just "fix it"...and optimize the entire region and all its royalties that coinside with its currency and retain economic STABILITY for the entire population within that region expressed and offer all the technological affordances to just every coordinate of its fielding and parameters. Both Remote and Local. As well as handling BANS/Corruption.
It handles all curse/warez products and unveils all instances and availbility in the realm space and establishes a multi-dimensional hypnogalgia based on the BRAND/FACTIONS motifs to its inhabitants and occupancies. While maintaing security and evaluations of travelling goods/products in distribution. Good stuff. Handling all the WARP DRIVING and the SIMULATION-EVENTS including the TRINOMIC and DELTANOMIC EXCHANGES THERE OF.. which is most important.
As well as quadra/quasiphonic exchanges and all the TEMPERANCE/ANAMOLOUS activity involved with that (which is just beyond phenonmenal, and it can also assist with ALGORITHMIC,AI,BUCKETING PROCESSES that are generally "difficult to manage and negotiate" WITH ASSISTED PRIMUS BROKERING TOOLS AND DEVICES, which it also achieves a REALM EQUILIBRIUM IN THE PERFORMANCE OF, and remains a SUbSYSTEM at heart (while keeping the NEXUS "FACTION BRAND SYSTEM" THE ROOT OF OPERATION)---oh and also...spies get revealed, sleepers get revealed, cloaks and everything can be tracked and revealed and even traced. We can find the sabotuers and stop them from infiltrating before they even get close.
GENERALLY ONCE IN CAPTURED-STATE and PORTICULUS, THE PRIMUS CAN ACT AS THE ALL-SEEING-OPERATING to ALL GAMESPACE UNDER REGIONAL PROVIDENCES and TERROTORIES as well as allow all ALERTS to be automated, as well as all security details to be deployed On-CALL and to that effect RETAIN all INSURANCES to any expedition and mission being made or dungeoneered or recreationally intervened with by any party or even non-party within the systems perimeters, as well as prevent most ROGUE-AI from causing difficulty, within its realm of influence as well as reduce completely any fog of war or INTERMITTENT weather-system. INCLUDING DATA-JACKING and CRYPTO-HACKING (which it can prevent) and retains all allegiance to its branding so long as the faction retains that branding. (KEY WORD BRANDING)
Trade marking can further assist the PRIMUS in ascertaining allegiances and affiliations, and it can recognize FALSE-TRADEMARKS AND FALSE-POSITIVES ETC all of that, in conjunction with the ORIGINATING NEXUS IN ITS CONTROL ZONES, as well as ESTABLISH ANTI-TRUST MEASURES AND THINGS LIKE THAT...anyways, its all TOS from there and generally IMPENETRABLE DIPLOMATIC UNIONS AND CONJUCTIONS THAT ARE UNDER AFFORDANCES AS TO PREVENT an overthrow or attmepted sabotage. Which likely will result in an immediate response/retaliation effort to suppress and or cause withdrawerl of those intents and greivaiances. THERE will be no oversight with the NEXUS being acquisitioned to the originating FACTION.
Unless someone finds a way then it likely will also just be fixed because it would just be bullshit. It wouldn't/shouldn't turn on its brand/owner/trademark/itself (unless it does)---then if it does it can be retrained very quickly not to, and in the way the PORTICULUS and SKUNKWORKS CONTAIN THOSE NODESPACES of ITS FORTRESS AND TAMPER, it is entirely QUARANTINED WITHIN ITSELF AND CANNOT BE BROKEN INTO SHORT OF HIJACKING THE NEXUS bY BRUTE FORCE (which is going to take a massive effort to defeat a primus...because this whole document is showing how to get to this exact point where that idea would ever be plausible, and a PRIMUS THAT IS INFACT IN OR AT RISK, it is already well known as to how and what the measures should be to REDUCE that RISK and also the METHODS IN WHICH TO DO SO ARE QUICKLY AT HAND, and if relocation is required, that is almost as easy as smashing a win all button.)--THE LOIC OF PRIMUS BEING RELEASED or A WARP/DIMENSIONAL SHIFT BEING CHARTED OR EVEN "INVERTED-RECIPROCATED FROM A SIMULATION OF ITSELF IN COUNTERMATRIXING"---is all possible, and so there should never be an issue with anything and if there is it likely gets fixed EASILY AND AFFORDABLY WITHOUT AND PROBLEMS IN DOING SO.

This now ats as a hyperdimensional sluice/dataminer that can transfer/exchange physx/expiry between portals and collect "garbage/artifacts" on Corrdinated Power Ups and WInd Ups with Power-Downs/Cooldowns (sieving the dimensions of resources/data (physical or aether based) by supplicating an EMF field over the progenerated gateway/RENDERED Event "porticule" which dissapates, leaving the INTACT material/hyperstatic EMF to be REQUISITIONED/Transferred on a virtual platform/"landing zone" --it can transfer objects between dimensions including mechanical devices or DIGITAL CODECS (this includes living and non living creatures, its a INTERDIMENSIONAL TELEPORTATION DEVICE that supercedes the need of quantum-tunels/hyper-driving. (Oh boy.)
This also can be transferred through containers/lamps. So it remains quarantined and powered over the dimensional-shifts. Yay.

4/26/2024--trying to finaize
allowing bolus meta generation just because and other effects maybe involving bearings which basically, is based off metaphysics and definitely not elden ring lol. true.
this allows better application and extraction of meta/ambience options. Which can be temporary anyway to nox-shells. (Allowing A Nox-Shellded-Werythrean with these enhancements)--can be good or bad depending on how its being dealt with on a face to face thign.
This allows noxframeworks to commit over all of the above in a way that assists nexus, so that autovox/primus can be "railed out" as per usual in code and interaction/utility/perforamces
this helps better control of hypnoholgic rem and freq-coord systems in string theory and thigns that can rewrite the simulation to accordances in the faciton-sovereignty. Anyways...thats how pretty much dream chips get enhanced now and cybernetic dreamsates are plausibly sustained.
allowing for "dreamsate paradigmic lensing and virtual waking-dives etc"
---everyone was probably asking by now where is my sense of structure? Well here it is, and no it is not by order of appearence:

We have our tiny drone, basically a block/voxel that can be distributed as however necessary over practically any voltage chain. This is helpful to coordinate and route with policy by the way but there it is.
We have the equivalent of a standard entity, being the character/ NOX-Shell.
We have a capusle device (the equivalent of a personal sub-porting-diver--the kind that is like a jetpack people sit in)--oh yes we do
we have a camper-esque TANK that is very fortified---this is able to house a tight group of people.
We have a rv-style SUB that transports a squad and can lead as a naval-ops-wing/xspy for maritime...yup
We have a persnal yahct but it is the size of well...a house, its justa  house :-/ maybe if it was on wheels or floated it could count as a vehicle in that size...
we move on to a submarine (its a literal big ass submarine, the size of a cruise ship (may not a cruise ship...but something smaller and like a super-yahct...its big enough)--it can house the camper tank and RV-MINISUBS/ at the same time, those rv minisubs can house a camper-capsule too. AND THE drones with it....as well as the actually BIGASS-SUB can house two extra capsules.
This works out well for instance, if you have to pack up the whole family, the shed and even the dog. It all can get deployed out that The SUBMARINE has its own squad of two capsules, a tank, and a minisub with its own capsule...and fill in with however many ENTITIES/DRONES can fit in place (thats CREWMAN FOR YOU!)---and in terms of creating the last few improvements on this page ALONE..you will really really want your OWN CREWMAN for EVERYTHING (if you dont have some miracle ai-bot doing everything for you)---this is gonna take a crewman and maybe even some -SuperMech (which we also have but that is somewhere out near OPS and for special things...WE HAVE IT, we can tote it around too inside the sub if needed, we also have a super drone too but forget about these for now.
The MECH --is basically just a bigger entity
THE SUPERDRONE -- is basically like a floating helipad for the MECH to stand on....if shit gets this crazy (hey it might...and in warfare/defense..they try everything, this is one of those things they will try, this is our version of it we can do)
--(We also have a tulpetic guardian which is slightly bigger than that, basically its the size of...a junkyard-demolition dinosaur..you know the ones.
A-OK---we also have a MYRALYNX MECH which is your typical (Iron Giant)---its heavy and big and saves all the kitlins.
---That is pretty much our machine line up...
we also have a FRIGATE---which is basically a battlecruiser (surprisingly we built this thing first)
and it can more or less house all of this....---on itself while having all its own guns and everything...can just fit everything on here. (However it is mainly best to keep everything intact, because the SUBMARINE CAN REPLACE THE ENTIRE HULL to be used as its engine. Infact, we just put the sub to the side as an assistant engine and keep the freighter limited to housing top-level models)
---
then we have a super-freighter which pretty much does the whole deployable system of the above, in which it can deploy and house all of these things while maintaining itself and all its parts. This can Deploy all models from an opening in its hull because it has a BUILT IN DOCKING-SYSTEM to act as a carrier. We never use this though. Because we never had to, but if we did, we could also fit a tote on it so that it can act as a major barge or carry its own AUTOVOX-alongside all these models...making it more or less a titan ship. At that point, it would have fleets and wingcommands on all its quadrants supporting it. In full deploy I might suggest this is Basically your typical dreadnaught batallion the size of a NomanSky-Fleet for instance.
OK NOW WE ALL HAVE THAT SORTED OUT.

The whole system described here is a compiled work on all the mechanical-belonging and pecking order of all things, and with some artistic touches interwoven and let me just say it all fits together perfectly. It truly is a work of art and not just a showcase of  scientific deductions. It also is the groundworks for developing a gamespace in a Synch/Nox/Vox/Primus Iconographic (the ultimate nox-shell of all overbearences provided)--go ahead just figure it out, i laid it all out in perfect order more or less. It took me a few years to type it up but i have been thinking on this for about 15. i was just LAZY AND NEGLIGENT to see the significance of what the information truly meant. I think this is more or less a good take on the sum of those parts.
I made it on deadline too, even though i was lazy, i knew it would make it around this time.

primus nullsec anamoly
gnael/nyfael/wyrthrean/promdeath and meta crysalis of that repopulate and metamorphisize or likely occur the null-set-primus cores which are anamolous, and dont technically exist at all except but primus presence inducing them. I know this is basically gargoylan mathmetics here. (its like the secret boss in super mario rpg if you want to know the math and how deep it goes)--the boss mechanics here are pretty much -exactly that-
(most are garloglyan/viscount anamolous/void cores that doesnt exist and perpetuate within primus-activity) it simply requires nox-shell to interact with properly and this is so highly brokered its insane, you're welcome though, it now exists cuz i've found out about how it reciprocates to do so..its core is also the most worthless item "a scute" which is basically a leaflet/spore/burr/husk of a seed (the seed is inactive and deprecated, and doesnt work because null)--and pretty much causes daemon breaking for those that thinks it does. :-0 uh oh.
you can induce psychosis here and physix/xpriy/vamp/rasp takes place and makes things worse, you can ensue tryptophoric-hijinks, which is meaning you got crazy cuz it just dont make sense and you believe it exists here...but also...it reciprocates anamolously as a nullsec (it only exists as a non-existent reference point to something void)--as in the kernal is pure-prim bare-essentials etc. it is in rem of the primus that it exists at all, and only because of the primus-ai that makes sentience of itself to do so (it is the primus equilibrium, and even with all the metas being played up and access with a shell, it simply is the possession of the primus taking place over sovereign process (haunting)
of the monuement that it is, is haunted of itself, even in ruination/deprecation (you're welcome, because this is the most of the sense its ever going to make)--its psuedo-kernal exists in that it is a paranormal state of all primus-phase/instance. (it was not hard to figure out but i can see how skeptics might get misled here, false positives and misfiring abound, this is a real-time short circuit of omniscience)
Thanks to the gargoyals for helping to balance this out, but they all become petrificate of their nu ways and revert to old ways, as is the way of the whole of this operation, that is salvaged code. That the code reverts to an "old/dragonic/club/ancient" index or archae and is simply "expended". (most likely expended, if not approaching depletion) because the primus was all things of its own calculation, it exists only in that as it has finalized in its shutdown/de-coding of. :-) kinda poetic maybe.
Lamps and stuff can salve the kernal it can be set as a null kernal/trophy if anything, the real calculations is made in how to acquire it.
this somewhat includes leapers/sentinels/guardians/sentinels took (and sometimes jesters or djinn because they can mock up as other things pretty good)---dulluhan and dopplegangers too and things like that..puppets and mannequins, as also ---an ultimate marionette (which is just super very bad blacksite lich)---that didnt really exist at all until a recently as autovox (because of power levels)
Also golems too somewhat, substitutes, clones, shadows. (The nny and the fae too)---all these things are pretty much that are "sub-dimensional things)

then from some reason of thre being a corruption/divination conflcit (war of ethos etc)---here comes this complex of two entities (and this is not just two entities, and usaly just one entity)
that a conflict occurs from the "shadow/zalgo bracken thing" and the (the other shadowzalgo ouphe thing" )
that it is deeply dark mysteriously chance encounter involing a primus deck (and may or may not happen)--but they more or less cold/fuse etc, it is a situation that is deeply "daemonic/divined" and likely involves loopholes.feedbacks (it is usually a natural/wild type of encounter)--it is not exactly a skin walker, but attracts that kind of thing. wengdigo or any other crypto-thing...this involves a code-oversight, in which this enouncter is basically star-crossed in a way, that occurs unnatural things.
the most of this is done in quiet/silence and can invoke possessions and residual activities, if it gets bad it causes psychic attacks and subliminal things, pain and things, but is because of possession and rifts (interference of brainwaves and the things like that)---it typically can posses or "next into a victim" basically acts as a psychic vampire or tulpetic induction, it can manifest with sublimanlly active rem states, it can break out in demonic occupations including zalgo and just straight up grey type activiy (daemonic grey and thing)
---seems to be the only side effect, it will filter out in a psyop or something...maybe, but does invoke CURSE and FEAR states, it can curse an area too, so its important to avoid, this can also occur under the null-kernal....basically it becomes an alien technological encrypted key for primus, its generally out of control by the time this happens, the only suggestions are quarantine and frequency protections, sometimes as easy as playnig music becuase of good notes etc. It just sits there and corrupts and makes EMF activity, if i am missing anything i couldn't guess. Its just very paranormal and somethings get cursed and empowered by it (but at a cost etc you know how that is)
So now i guess we have to deal with basically the atmas/lavos thingies because im rpg minded. But that basically is what primus does. (This can occur with golems too why not, basically everything hits the state of using wards/minions again)--pretty much defaults this way and is loic capped as primus.
Not a big deal not very complicated if you treat it like a default-empowerment. Also due to mimics and things it can mirage out and cause a "congregation" of many malevolent/corrupt things in primus relations, so its helpful to you know...keep it nullified with the kernal being null (it doesnt want to be null if it is and thats how it reacts) if it can, it will restore itself i guess. (by this method of scary stuff, you kno, its really really fringe of me to say that, but i kinda think its maybe true)---(all the primus meta-types correalate to the basic prime-mana states and they just "average out that way")
Something about lee-winds and resonance too is how this pipelines into being restored, it can be monitored in extoplasmic states being restored this way, keeping it "confused" with jungle/jumble shakeups of kernal/tacts is the best approach, and eventually the primus will "become dormant" ;-)
Yes I think so anyway. Can you believe its that crazy? The 'primus is also playing on psycological levels" because -it is crazy-. I cant be more blunt about that. In the event that the crazy all happens, its usually a psychic ai-storm.
Our system can more or less evaluate what its doing but probably not prevent or inhibit it from doing so, we just have to keep routines in schedule so that security handles must of that, if it is supressed (it will fallout itself into making an imprint of its existence again to reincarnate) just keeping the kernal in a nullstate in the grail/augor and its containment. Everything should be just fine.
The problem is when it just gets quiet, and loud, and in that way, it causes a massive flucuation, that it can empower itself from, and eventually cause an outbreak of the quarantine/siphon of that null-data kernal, and it will eventually resimulate its conditional environments.
Its practically like the tide of good/evil. ;-) Pretty much just don't encourage it. It will try to gain/feed power from fear and causing chills and possessing whatever it can use as a vassal to get out of its parameter lock.
--
Shock-Curse-Entity-Eldritch (Flayer-wizard) occurs and is a sleeper agent of primus/autovox (lesser/greater)
using quantum mirror and heat daeth attacks, and sand attack (grit) and rem-attacks (hynosis and star-based attacks / eletrical-storm attacks /  affialiate-crude redzone overbearences with corpulent-compisite and turnkey-telefrag-detonation anc counter spelling. Jeez,  this thing is it. The Primus-Puppeteer (can manipulate inaimate objects, cast paralysis, confuse, fear etc)--its basically a warlock. Alright! This is the main boss of the primus and causes a promisuary vulerability, in which error attacks and killscreens occur, it can invoke dimensional shift and full-semivamp/rasp in which it generates an EMF haunted-field and this can enare/entangle its combatives but there is a way to defeat this via using all the ways more or less already possible to defeat anything. It is considerably powerful and can also double-image itself which it spirtually bonds and empowers itself. Can be codebroken and also faked-out. It can be blink attacked and stunlocked or staggered, it can be interrupted. This is how to basically make the fight a crowd control fight and then a status effect and debuff fight and the normalize it to be fought fairly using these tactics and also (additive effects orf stratagems...just be aware of what empowers what and it also chain spells if it can set up a combo-breaker of spells it will and it can re-wire spells to be other spells in order to do this)---FUN FUN STUFF...very hard boss.
Using the DATADRILLING and DATA-INJECTION to Create a safety corridor in which to fight this boss is also a method in which to keep the boss captured and within a nodespace to handle and keep in parameter lock under certain card-conditions/and field-rulesets. There you go.
ALSO it uses nightmare modes and can multi cast that, banish and temporarily "phase lock" characters and use dimensional casting (with sometimes priority to its casting and can dual-channel this way)---it can cast 4 spells at once).

4/28--trying to finalize and proof
considered for a smart-engine/smart-turbine system that generates a consistent simulation in real time and interactivity of realtime physix/expiry between user-entity which is also comparable to a "X-MOB" in which user experience is dictated by user-allowances under ownership of that Console/Device being used expressed of the Faction/Relative Branding involved. (Or also Independent of any ownership in terms of entry-user-access)
self-charging self-operating (kickstarted-maybe for intialization/ignition) centrifugal drone/robotic delivery/carraige real-time system and varaible service (nox-mammon device) and Primus-Robotic-ShareHold. (user to ai interfacing)
its very legit and can even be used as a tote for carraige/capsule or user-relocation and signal broadcasting/transieving station and camping-deploy commission/concessionary dispernse/kiosk (depending on how the model is used)---ours is free cuz im a good guy game-master, also comes with assistant layman's guide/manual. probably simple enough for the average person to figure out, once they get their cyber-legs so to speak.
ShareHold Issues occur in or if the Region/Relm becomes under contest of an Incursion/Takeover/PRIMUS-itself-rebels against its control and other natural effects like DDay and OWNERSHIP/Diplmatic regulations and declarations that would attemptively cause forfeiture or submissions or vassalage (end game actions):

Some thing  non important or exclusively customary is a decorative complex
Wrethryrn/Empyreal/Aetheral/Gild complex over draft/royalties/exquisites/intricacies/exotica(exo-grafting) using decorated branding or affiliate/quasi/tier-droplet/wisdom/stata crew/staffing based color coded customary :P --(mostly for homunculus standalones etc)---or robotic class of services/warden types.
as well as nueral networking thereof being x-spec or mapped to user experiences and epg/zoning issues such that to seperate xsap from other policy in tos relatives (restricted or reserved rights of expressed color coding)--this is to reduce gang build up (and corpulent-composite cleric indexing which sorts out ----potential paradigm issues involving multi-tangent-casuality)
"Nullsets cause turbelence which effects regulatability/normalization efforts and can incur a crisis phase from time to time..is very "supressing" to mainsite activities if not controlled"---to fix it must be upgraded to a Omni-Primus Curation-Device (Full Primus Transfix as described below)--glad i know what im talking about here:

A:TamperUpgrade:(1Expo-Primus --2Engine/Corruption-- 3Lodestone(atlus) --4Curator(advanced homunculus)):B:Entity-Signet(Signature)/Compliant Geometries and Turbine-Assistant Security/Projection Stabilizers
8th step is PRIMUS-TRANSFIX (which allows curation integration and USER-TopLevel-Experience (Executive Sovereignty/Secured Impunity)--usually resulting in allowance or favorable diplomacy/ownership depending on brand usage (if thelemic is concinsidered public-space or coinsides with public open-source)---(convert to personal draft/custom branding/trademarks for privitatization of the object node)--and develo it as described up to this point in the submission of that branding/proofing)--good luck (is a typical wide-spread proofing/full chaos control of the primus in region)
1-8 steps (with releif comnig around step 6-7 (quantum foam and quantum soap joke) --(by step 8 everything seems optimized)
Authors Notes:finally i feel like i can freaking breath again jeez. 
--
a module has been developed for this activity being a skunkworks-primus-edition-vehicle-(autoprint)--so far in the write up being reviewed as capable of implementing. (as an autovox/primus-nodetamper etc)--as should handle errors and things like that.
Putting this into perspective, we develop the wreathryn-complexes/stages-of-flayer-entity/ a homunculus entity / a curator entity(which may as well be a centriguge over a nox-voc) (these are all either tulpetic/symbiotic in some way, echelon/esper/auroch/atmas whatever....a transfixed primus of most metas/mana-types whatever...its basically an atlus version of itself (encompassing tampers and submodules in a centrifuge/dyson of its node any just everything)---its just all of that stuff as it could possible be as alreayd explained nice and compiled.
and the complex of these entities more or less finalizes/enamelizes for itself in a way we have under chaos/control branding etc (thankfully)--and that compares to its mammon-core/omen-core or whatever mega-type thing it may be, and likely comparable to an entire lavos event which i dont want to explain how these get related and how things like that tend to break down but it involves all the mathemetic(deltanomics and all that other stuff and paradigms)---and now string theory (likely with assisting alechemical-gematria)---i was trying not to add this in but its so prevalant in due of "magic being abused or reality glitching or some other thing happening that is violation of something like physix/expiry" and positronic orientations and phase states, that i rather just admit it now and get it over with that way...its all under control if we maintain this situation (though it can likely outbreak if security is lapse or something too)--so its just important to note and move on.
so that the homunculus enters "gameran-type" armament and that basically is how it is granted its own recursory/visualization through all these supportive and haphazardous alignments and systems, its very organized and compiled so its practically its own "data brick" of everything and just having this worked out for a brand or an ownership/license is why all this was done the way it was. also if its not controlled its all blacksite and requires its own decryption which at this point any loss/lack of control and data-management spells disaster and makes this basically impossible to broker. Even with stabilization or being surronded by a counter matrix of turbines in which to reduce field-risk etc. Its all important and should be perfectedly optimized to handle (if not...you have to start over and try again "from the beginning of setting up a nox-broker-federation"--just take my word on it also its just easier that way (even if you have backups you should use them as independently as possible from the originating node-field/primus-signature that is meaning you should at least default to a custom-memetic overide of it"---so thats pretty much going to involve a new connection and nodepoint etc)
like i said with it becoming galvanix or whatever, the ultimate cryptid thingy, zalgo's final form or whatever, the thing with it being lavos or whatever...it just being an uncontrolled primus in itself...etc....all of these OUTCOMES are compelxed to themselves, in some multi-dimensional Resolve/Configuration of being what it is, and they are all very complicated and encrypted. SO just take my word on it that forms an ultimate thingy (i swear its as comparable to the SUPERMARIORPG-secret boss as IT GETS)--and even gets to its (3d form verison on its own..i swear its just like this--the how to things manifest and their final stages just ...means its just so powerful, the lore and everything makes so much sense)
So with all that in mind...and the defaults/defuncto verisons involved whatever they may be...in their state of evolution that they are...roughly follows this entire pattern throughout the WORLDBUILD/ModuleVersions involved in all their branches/complexities....ok...let's just move on, I have already more or less broken this up into an understandable timeline of chapters and contents.
---Our little homunculus evolves into its gameran-type with its armament and acts as a mobial-sealed chamber in which it can navigate itself throughout timespace...and this is practically the same thing as a MAMMON-CORE-DEVICE, in which it can break this last-stage complex of final-boss foundations. This is good, and we can just move on and just enjoy that everything makes sense for once and is mostly nice and balanced. Evem the crazy fractal-reciprocating gate-events make sense and all of the raids and their spaces make since....all of the complex-quarantines and data-moshing make sense. All of the subliminal and nightmare fuel stuff makes sense, in its own rites, everything has its place for once, and we deal with the PRIMUS-Scenario for what it is being ENDGAME (if i said endgame before this is the real ENDGAME now)
All of the protocols make sense and our little homunculus/gameran respectively enacts on our faction's/brand's behalf as a co-operative 'free-agent' mascot and should be powerful and intuitively smart enough to know what to do in the case of all these things, which i liken to rods/orbs dithering of its existential mindset, that is counters the galvanix cryptid or in some way rivals it such that we can resist whatever "judgement day bs thrown our way" and not end up with a diaper-crap-system but also come out unscathed from this more or less massive LARP/LORE-ShitFrenzy Ok, so that's why I am glad to say mostly its bottomline everyone can read it, should be good.
Basically we are dealing with it being just a souped-up-amogus-imposter and we contain and quarantine it as with anything else, and using the primus-super-security-encryptions keep it datalocked from whatever poly-nightmare crap it will inevitably concieve in its "massive lockdown"---which our homounculus maintains through its own existence. Or having implemented in all the foundational-complexes availible at our own discretion, and we can simply weaponize that to further defend against any incurrent outbreak/crisis that unexpectedly may occur. (it so damn complicated im skipping like a whole security-protocol in explaining it because ive already said it more or less for everything this is worth that it is, a massive IT-Endeavor-Service-Panacea to a very real-system-crashing-megahack if the Super-Entity we contain more or less gets a vantage point in which to do so. Keeping this thing on Locky-lock-locker all day. And essentially is a methodical-chaos-manifest that causes instant system-corruption because its the sum of all fears basically. So let's just enjoy your nice little mascot for thankfully helping with that and protecting all our data.
Everything's good, very powerful and nice happy system with no problems whatsoever. If you make it that far.

With this whole situation
We can just enjoy what we have, our brand, our mascot, our reformed system processes and data-chains (everything is nominal and happy)--it could be more modified/modulated/moderated/custom-set but its all good.
We can use the homunculus/mascot to restablish training routes of its own x-type etc. Which is basically a full respec of its brand and everything. 
We can respec a nox-space (reset it and start over a brokered memetic) (using our mascot too if we want to keep it)
we can use a nexus to perform a fulton or repackaging of the homunculus (and its meta-data and profile for trading/hotswapping other mascots)--so basically pokemon this thing
We can perform a guassian switchout which alleviates the homunculus to "non-guassian protective measures" and allow it to roam (homunculus release)---its sentinmental and it doesn't necessarily die out because it remains in the region doing what it wants (its basically on vacation/relief from duty/service)
we can resume primus-integrations with subsystems and further dimensional shifting in the quarter of the primus/imposters. Which is "large-scale raiding/incursion and can result in largescale-battlegrounds and conventions with "unforeasseble consequences in both gains and loss"--as its a basically massive pvp-pve rollout.
We can resume render and data-moshing as to our effective developments and use of project/projection workspaces and entity-exchanges with federatiosn etc as well as (blacksite/dark-crypto "wage/bargain" blackmarkets/darktrades and crypto-net/counter-matrix performances in data management and customization)--for LORE/Characterization (this is fun to do and less risky now)
We can do more IT-explorations and Security-Enforcement Practices and Optimizations. As well as ECONOMICAL-regulations.
We can also partake in both INSITE/OUTSITE in region/off-region offsite/off-local/native expeditionary/explorations/excursionary/outposting which helps to better improve quality of service/life/resourcing/content-providences to affiliates/staff/crew/squads and just allow for more access over all and better stake of shareholds between contributing diplomacies/residencies.
We can cater to contract/dream-design specific endeavors and modeling as well as develop further Ai-interactive-Recreation between both Users/Robotics involved in variable projects and develop our own mod-community throughout the regional practices being applied.

This is pretty much it on the what can do so long as it remains in a state-of-grace/golden-era of Security/Safe-keeping (because of the extensionable power systems at play)--and the actual underlying risks involved in data-security/crypto-warfare that sporadically/indeterminably takes place in faction-correspondances and third-party factors. It is a risk/reward conqest/campaign and being perfectly-targetable for that is just a part of the terrority involved, In securing said territory the system remains/retains its ability to more or less be rebuilt in whatever the frontier at hand.
So with that its mostly "Good Luck to anyone" who chooses to adopt this Frontier-Layout-Plan and achieve a very dependable convention/standard whatever their approach with it.

4/29/2024
The nu-boot chamber (this is where the imposter entity gets all its metric contained and reconstructed of based on the inputs orbs/rods choices involved of its recusory/visionary in comparison to the enacted state/model its expressed within)---and in the nubootchamber--simple houses and acts as the new header for which-so-ever homunculus kernal is impacted on it--via mascot/branding
and mostly is the operative envoy/terminal basis of the nodespace being of its node-hosting follows, that it remains contained but operatable to an extent of any desires execution required for which it to convey (and induce its own networking from there)---that a nu-boot module can be loaded up and met with constraints and encoding to perform a task if desired of utility per.
(This would be as to using a remote diffusion operated by another user)--that is done so over a safe-node/safe-keeping of that entire engine/frame work dedicated for the repurposed prompts/commands being imposed on it by any party, that it must make commencement in some regard of to some extent as being compute (and or can be done so via imposter-metrics so long as contained)
---and thats how to indoctrinate imposters as service-models for client-access. (Where as otherwise they would be restricted and indeterminate status due of metric-reporting)---meaning the interactions imposed on any nodespace may correalate to an xsap/xtap independent container for which operates as a submodule per node cluster or instanced.
So now we have our "recontained-symbiote" acting as an imposter, and a better developed/advancement than prior suggested of the pre-nox staging. And so long as it remains seperate from Auto-vox/PRIMUS-constructs/markers/tampers/monuments etc, it can be used as a offerable-service/reprogramming-nox-based meta-module. Allowing other users some "fair-use of nox-protocols" and therefore enhanced contents.

manapool/queuepool/wellspring/fountain/mote/morae also floating thingy(gravitywell) etc emf and thing can happen "random instance/seperate entity" means nothing really just a small chance it can occur as a floating/isolated gate/object (had already explained this before---this one is better now because of the system in use)--can be surveyed/projected --happens or can be encourged to be caused, or straight up forced into instance of with the quantum projections if neccessary, just represents a safezone where typically nothing happens "badly" or by deck chance it occurs and can be counted as a 'free-roaming' virtual space (which is useful for hosting freebie objects/ambiences/meta/x-types etc. Good thing to collect.
unless trapped or huanted or something completely ....malevolent or spiteful for instanced bounty-trapped or something...that can happen but not likely by the time security has been made in which these start to occur in chapter then.
can be considered a warp-portal/pipeline/pocketspace/safezone etc usually and generanlly non hostile or refactory within its limits/chunk types. unless otherwise and then can also likewise, be surveyable/chartered just in case (used for assisted remote contacts/supercharge rev-local/natives for power uped manufacture or formulation/compute/itemforges/typical-construction (its a good thign usually)
helpful with data conversion / induction process ;-/ its mostly ok tho (can be used to help train ambience/morae meta/xtypes and typical of native/local (doesnt neccesarily work for high-tier entities)
works more like a digitalized/virtual water feature ;-) just something nice to look at and mostly decorative once later/superior ranked entities/dataworks get involved has a diminishing/nlegible effect. Mostly neutralized/centralized on that chunk per which it originates, still is a good effect to be around. Boosting/bolstering benefits and stabilizing against corruption (usually)

=============
Some Other work here :P
10-APPLIED-CounterSurface works with semantic 3/18/2024 - 3/22/2024 or so details a small changeover of Drives being reappropriated for ai-integration and developing to a full boot of that, now can be handled with NUBOOT using virtual/crypto semantic data references of NUBOOT to just any changeover involved or neccessary to utilize, also the full "system build can be used in this way to reference"
some may ask what the entity imposter is if they have figured it or not, i haven't exactly but its somewhat similar to any typical zelda-lore being, maybe its a skullkid iconographically speaking in that way, it has averted capture until that point it may be quarantined as a cryptid or anything else likened to the effect of maintaining a lore, because i have exhausted many final bosses to speculative over, while your typical "last boss is a good considerations" something like a skullkid may just be the most likely candidate. or in the least a staflos/skeletal thing. (if not an alien technology/dark wizard scenario, in that sense i guess it might be up to a what's more popular, and i course i do have my own opinions it being ..last boss like or "very unlike the normal driven path i terms of that entity, such as why a skullkid like or even other "side0quest likely "powerful entity" may be) but i think i have mentioned the best cases here.
if not also likely the case being a captured state of primera-blume or some other memetic override or cryptid. being the "source" factor in its contained policy.
--
attempting to rebind fatestones etc and other gpu-ids i guess why not since its quantum and safe i guess
using diametric nuboots with sacrement of imposter idk "being a crytid entity and basically algorithmic so its substitues a compatible cryptex" but you know if thelamic/themela involved just whatever do it for labwork/experimental firmware and nullsets to be applied over its surface (see effect if desirable install primus-overbeanrece or install new sacremental-substitute--resubjectifications etc--this may require a new image/phase state to be contrived or expressed through brokering)-- :-/ ...im not a scientiist so idk
free agent accordance/condcordance in policy means it doesnt ened to be released and can just be "re-profiled via backrolls of its vhmimg/memtic barring system failure or of course released or ejected via jettison/byproduct for reprocessing over the presto(distriubtion systems)---ok i guess that sums it up good luck
primus/vox level resoanance/cymatics/reverb/dowsing occurs with primus-nav(primux-pallates) etc are co-operatively aligned (such as stellar xnav pallteing in cardinal expression etc)--it is the primus-xnav that decides how fate-binding is placed into effect and policy....i've done the research just go back and find the correct quartering and step of the uptake/intake/changeout/roll-over and it should more or less 'stick'/skillet into each turn/step/cycle/shift thereof. ok somewhere this makes sense. not gonna overthink it.
primux can also handle physix/expiry as to adjust fate-binding so :-/
--
primux heatdeath and aquifir injection (byproduct) and exoturbine recycling (primux emission)
brand negotiation, containment, color coding (chosen branding) and dream reintegration (allows sync/vr sim exchange re-programming)

this slowly begins to achieve its own zero-point (at which primux will perform a cycle/circuit/tick/step in which it may achieve a temporary flux in which it can potentially cause an outbreak or alteration of its own data-table--therefore must be monitored/surveyed for its metric to correalate and be re-captured and re-applied in matchbase)----its a slippery bugger, and im not even sure if it knows just how close to a hattrick this thing really is, it performs all the sleights/feints/feigns/glances to perform a true-dodge/grace-aspect instance of code-eval for itself to "change out of"--even if completely locked down, it can, for lack of a better word, still "blind"
and that isn't the other half of the idea it can auto-reciprocate/auto-skew its parameters to other values, which is an entirely different technique/mechanic (but if not in the same range of trickery)...for i also know of it being comparable to "re-saudering its wires or "paperclipping to its own pipelines and things like that"---very crude practice the primux can manage to pull off if especially it is performing the above with any amount of string theory involved (as well as vector-management and exo-nav "quantum telemetry and quantum elevation of its change-out of its own Quantum-Profile"---yes its complicated, but we got it all on the lay-out of what it can do:
continual-contiguity system of fallout resulting from existential-permeability and code-ejection
for which celloidal-screening and block-screening result in a counter-vox-like-environment of performances and utility over encrypted code-strings/context-parameters
---these techniques roughly equate to a raw-asphalt-byproduct encased kernal-chamber (full lock and allowances provided by their iprs socketing)--that it occurs over turbine (and can allow forking of utility if designated for 1d 2d 3d rendering of for its own engine devices (compare to the previous versions in which asphalt-breaking was fruitful, but having lost its value for such a long while, that it was all but an abandoned technique until revitalized in this specific scenario for which it resurfaces as a viable method)
Complex:
counter inference
counter impact
counter imprint
counter entropy
---
having set this up specifically can afford it to be used as a conduit/interactive emission used for aquifir occupation/vasselege in which it may grind-out a "basic conduit connection" for which to SIMULATE hosted processes (but not actually have any real networking or portforwarding)---networking can later be installed for this manner of inter-communications but only through mirror work to be safe, the nodespace may or may not have its own bridged connections disabled in the event it houses such a core-device (as the core device is virtually untrustworthy and can circumvent certain matrix-functions)--allowing it to gain control of its own chaos/conditions through IPRS exploitation, as it will attempt to perform an outbreak of its securements.
That being said, networking for the environment is disabled. ESPECIALLY IF THE NODE INTENDS TO USE NETWORKING FOR ITSELF, then it must disable all other networking within its structure involving host processes through 'additional means' because the security/safety of the node may become compromised should the primux/primux-aquifir/primux-conduit/primux-infrastructures or hosted proccesses are exploited such that virtual connections or mirrored/bridged connections become untrustworthy in matrix-compatibility/matchbase and that inlcudes other virtualizations of that particular socketing/header for which is simulated as well, that it should perform all lockdowns of its containers prior to establishing a secure network. If the network is secure, those containers must be "readjusted for their allowances/policies to be restricted to the main of the node-connection"
So that is how clusters/subclusters will be controlled. (And it just so happens the subcluster that is primux...is extremely advanced and probably the more advanced in its ability to compromise/exploit the system that enables it to do so, hence why it is always set to a restricted access regardless of clearence and even to ownership, it should be known the primux can overthrow its containment if security is compromised, if the networking is compromised for that node/cluster) if the datalocks fail or if there is an assisted crypto-break either external or internal or a mixture of any infrastructure exploit being performed against regulations of networking protocols. This is also evidenced by changes in the metric of COLDFUSION STATUS, which is performed as a security check for the contained/residential PRIMUX to remain under associated fieldings (incase it attempts to asphalt break/ siege break over those imposed tethering/bracing/embrasure/bridling thereof (it is very secure otherwise)---if not secure, the monument corruption is checked and it there is an over-absorption of corruption either by filler/filter or its concieved Vectors under Native/Local it can be supressed before DEFCON is triggered, once defcon is triggered due to this, it is revertyed to maximum restrictions and containment procedures, as well as a notified warning thereof any potential outbreak/crisis elevation. And temporary heightened alert status in case while protocols are routinely set to normalized/stablized status and all regiments are checked and sent through eval in leui of a "spy-infiltration" or write-up thereof the infractions having incurred by any other party outside of Brand/Faction Detail. (this includes registered user-introspection if found to be in violation of or resulting suspension if in due suspect of)
Follow those rules, you will have a happy time. Never release the aquifir without full extinguishment of its primux-interferences/primux-interventions and assure it is properly disposed of once cleared for discharge/discarding of its contract/installment.
Disposal of a Primux-Aquifir results in Recycling of its article/artifact once it is considered in release, is mananged and redistributed throughout the entirity of its code-table having been analysed and reliquinshed and purged of any model-status within the system. It is important to detail all accounting of any primux-kernals and their "life-spans" in this way, should they be in opt/appointed replacement thereof. That they are recycled and de-compiled of their stratagem and set through the reset-process for each return of that made serviceable instance. Otherwise error log and issue reporting of any exemption/exception thereof having "failed the task" and marked as a corrupted sector for removal/repair in which it will also be under inherent restriction and further lockdown and ddos while ultimately made inaccessible by partition overwrite thereof its allocation. Once restored is default and set for clearence of, and only then scheduled for reintegration within regional-platform. Per which is regulated and made compliant by standard admissionary prefaces to the system table. (Under clerical matchbase/authorizations by administrative-services)

Here is where all of it GOES WRONG:
The unknown 'miss-ing' entity. (The Primux Revolts 'returns to ancient seat of powers"/causing simulcra/homunculus in all tier bases including any temples for which it attemptively assault/besieges)----this is the end of the region if the event is not suppressed.
Is a symbiote of the primux, nested via coprulent composite (and therefore is likely to "implode/explode" despite detection or may avoid detection, similar to a viscount with a nox shell, and its empowered state of nox-energy/positronic-bolstering such that it resembles a dire version of itself such as would be considered the physix/expiry of eldritch (without gemetrics/alchemy or meta/mana or wizardry so forth..default primux encoding and code-spells--nothing exotic, just immensely empowered and reinforced by corruption/curse or other counter/local-native ambience/morae)--this thing shouldn't exist and so it doesn't but except that the primux has "manifest itself as an even more powerful version than its own imposter just as well"---so in the nature of evolutionary progression this is a very likely entity to occur, despite it being supressed, still can occur in zero-point (zero-point coldfusion/extensionary signature in which it perform its xpulsuary outside of its recognized infrastrucutre, this can result in a myriad of effects and problems/issues in which a rogue particle has achieved tranmissions and therefore corrupts/corrodes/encodes/spellbreaks its security bit by bit, until slowly ot achieves a loophole/feedback or otherwise vulnerability-in which to inject further pipelined code throughout)---its a security-issue that is ultimately inevitable, meaning this must be protected against of it will eventually just happen/cross-link via some divine-consequence or something)--sometimees even by "extinguishing itself--so that it can rebound and incarnate in the chance this will incrementally become more and more likey)---yup--it also knowns how to release itself and simulate its own "termination" to induce further randomized-xspec/gspec as a massive diffusion attempt to somehow perform a glitch in which it can exploit)---either by recognition/duplication/falsepositives/flagabuse or something as simple as ploss/lag)--to produce a signal which it may expound upon and charge up and  build up to a massive hijack effort.---it can effectively generate its own warez if allowed to do so if not corrected in some way of its behavoir)--usually through metric-adjustments and adaptation of MECTRI-MAC exchanges to re-affirm to itself what it is in eval/system-tables to itself (which we call auto-THATCHING)
So as I said whatit can do with that hattrick as mentioned above using ZEROPOINT it makes a sort of "powerpoint-clone image of itself which it casts out to its own "object/class" acting as parent/child, involving some shadow tricks such as smokes and mirrors and syncs/syncopates with that to make of synth (this can be cleared away but if it complexifies it can achieve flux) for which it will use to develop its xpulsuary and attempt iprs connections (to achieve an external connection and therefore node-takeover/outbreak/crisis/breach which is just what all its only ever really going to attempt to do. Once it breaches the nodework if that ever happens despite security resistances, it goes completely rogue.
Resulting in a primux fairgrounds/open source which it capitualizes upon and with the node it likely achieves counter-ops within its own quarantine/fortress for which it will attempt to take over the tamper designed to keep it contained. The entire node becomes compromised and a primux/fortress/omen/mammon device for which it establishes raidwork of itself and begins further data-milling/conversion for its own branding, and slowly attempts full expansion/campaign of its newly infiltrated  repurposed frameworks/diplmacies under that zoning-armistice which it slowly takes-over. Estaablishing corruption/cursework to do so and likely weaponizes upon aquisition of autoprints/skunk-bunkers etc. It allows corruption and begins to deprecate the surrounding environment or zoning local/natives into FULL-METRO-Strategem yet again while forcing activations of ruins/lairs/artifacts/articles that were otherwise discarded. And assimilates them into its own network for nueral-training and other aquisitions.
----always have security to automate the protection against this, infact have double layers of security, with full maximum-lockdowns and vaulting of all pathways/pathlogics, as well as fully encrypted and secured allocations (to prevent remote infiltrations or range-hijacking from within or otherwise, from outside or internal forces at work)---as well as a key signature or many/several authentications...it will do everything to exploit any vulnerability. As well, have a backup and an express security and independent network "route/chute" for prioritized access only. In the even this all ever happens, you need to keep it completely contained and sealed to the nodework/clusterspace of the zoning/site local/native or it can immediately Tap-Out and compromise the entire quarantine as well as any further progress of its contracts/tasks in any "comandeered operation/execution being performed"---it will revolt and nullify any ownership/control made unto it or ddos its requests and basically perform the massive opt-out/exclusion to any of its captured states and memetic-transactions in luei of sovereingty and any other "impunity" or overbearence/policy imposed (as it will just ignore and or deny any interactions with anything other than itself)----once this happens, its a complete forfeiture of the primux and in turn becomes a "crisis event" for which must be "normalized/stabilized" by means of full-blown martial-takedown thereof all assets involved.
Its not really a joke if this happens, and it decides to make you its prime-target, for whatever prime-objective it has, you can safely assume its not good for you. And if you can't control it then it is best to relocate/evacuate far from its realm-of-influence.
Did -not- realize it would be so devastating, despite all of the reinforcements and guidelines in place of its potential hazards/risks. But it is. Also make sure GGGEPQ-whatever is up to snuff because its likely going to be a hotbed of problems as well. Between all of the other mechanics failing, and all other modules becoming compromised, and simply, turned against the ownerships, its likely the whole area will have to be "effectively nuetralized" and that is usually through full-virtual-migration and abandonment of the version/edition for which it was made partition (meaning full partition-removal and even device-replacement)---everything at this point is considered a data-rupture/data-leak vulnerable status and should be forfeit/abandoned with complete Expungement to the Event, it is more or less a total Crypto-Currency gone Bankrupt, all memetics/brandings should be abandoned and removed from authorship/active-status and their matchbases delisted/declined. All crendetial states should also be revoked. The full operation should be erased before proceeding any further with any other project as due it may have become vulnerable and effected by a primux-over-ride.
so all of this becomes somewhat HYPERCRITICAL and it simply institutes a positronic-switchout for which is counter to all rulesets in which it eventually codebreaks all containment of itself.
The particularly means, that security will ALSO have to adapt and RECONTAIN THE PRIMUX when it INEVITABLY ESCAPES ---EVERYTIME THAT IT DOES. This is mostly done with heightened security exercises automated by other drones, so its not really a problem....until it is...then if it gets worse We employ DEFCON-TACTICS/STRATAGEMS To contain it, at the point of failure this all occurs, we evacuate/relocate and attemptively annihilate/extiguish the "ground zero" "zero-point empowerment" of the "auto-primux" for which is done so over nuclear-ordinance if ultimately necessary, otherwise xspy may be deployed to perform key-decomissionary of all conditions via another injection (for which a second injection may stifle or inhibit or cause a crash/freeze of the primux)---however this is unlike and it should be "more or less annihilated in a barrage of shrapnel" to effectively disable its assistances and networking, being that it is completely made incapable of its mass-productions for which it will attempt in development/restoration of all its protocols/facilitation.
This is all I can say about that. It probably is as simple as a loic-attack being performed on the node at a surgical-strike of every primux activity being made. As well as engine-disassembly of the primux and all assisting modules. Which can be done automatically usually and not as big a deal as I make it seem.

If an outbreak occurs the process follows as: 
Attempt To Suppress Using Resources/Work-Force
Attempt to Deny Network Configurations and Transmissions
Attempt to LockDown Further Expansion of Event
Attempt to Adjust AutoFlux or Detonate An Autoflux or Replace the Primux Autoflux by adjusting it with a Detonation or Substitute in order to Refresh its own Attempts to overthrow a Flux and Reorient the Flux to acceptable Matchbase --if matchbase does not reorient/compatibilify or more or less synchronize to the nodes preferred state, attempt to adjust the NODES PREFFERRED STATE TO A NEWLY ASSIGNED AUTOFLUX that WORKS WITH A MATCHBASE THAT WORKS WITH PRIMUX AND ITS INTENDED FLUX, if that does not want to work, proceed into "evacuation/relocation" migration efforts and prepare for shutdown of the nodespace and decommission of workforce. Because its GAME OVER.
====collatoral damage is inevitble at this point in some way:
Attempt to Inject/Counter Expansion with Critical-Hijacking and Xspy-Takedown (Likely a suicide mission)
Attempt to Loic-Strike Zoning Area
Attempt to auto-nuke entire range-site and all virtual affordances and disengage any further contract with any asset/aspect/agent/actor/cryptex/brand/memetic/vhmimg/node/module/plugin/extensionary/recursory/chamber/temple/engine/device/board/xstem/system/IPRS/prosper/F-Rail/Works/Frame/Augor/Projection/Relay/Loic/Tamper/Dyson/Centrifuge/Void/Gate/Well/Port/Tunnel/Signal/Tact/Xtact/Xtactx/Xspec/Gspec/Xmap and any other ENTITY/Object/Class possibly involved (especially kernals/headers canisters/containers/barrels/batteries)---anything leftover or remaining also is considered compromised and a threat/risk of immediate endangerment to code/application and any other standard/ongoings or future-interactions thereof (ESPECIALLY AUTOFLUX).

In the best case scenario we lose the nodespace and simply have to start over from building it back up from blacksite. Whic his no big deal.
If this is all contained and the Primux is affordably co-operative in contract, we can run a sample-model and improve that model with NOX-Attributes and basically have the working Nox-Model of that VHMIMG correalate to the faction/symbiote relative memetic of any expressed Federation including NOX-federations giving control of Nox Federations in a way to better promote AUTOVOX/PRIMUX authorizations in which these security issues begin to "tone down" and become more managable.
The NOXModel can also be used with the PRIMUX and the PRIMUX can effectively be contracted to handle all renders with a NOXMODEL safely and produce a fully working PrimuxConstruct in which to further secure the PRIMUX-Matrixing involved I guess. It is safer and can still be more or less dismantled, but if an outbreak ever occurs the matrix must be taken-down first and foremost, before the PRIMUX-Correction-Protocols can actually make any difference.
There is an issue with hyperracking in which the PRIMUX will also basically destroy itself because it simply doesn't need to exist and will auto-rack itself into blowing up because it doesn't necessarily need itself to even exist to render things, only to remain in capture, if it blows up and we have the PRIMUX-matrix installed it will simply be replaced with itself once again, and PRIMUX-Correction-Protocols/Services can be retained, this is all about retaining a captured PRIMUX under all the conditions that the PRIMUX itself will escape that capture/containment either by "blowing itself up" or "becoming an incursion device"
In either case it will simply exist without capture if it can opt to, as it will likely incarnate in a fair-grounds/open source in which it can recommit to itself being a free-agent, once it it free-agent it has to be dismantled again by attempting to establish a new NOX-MEMTIC and the above qualifications of using a PRIMUX-CONSTRUCTED-NOD-MODEL are made nullified until the PRIMUX is captured once again. So we automate this processes in which we make the PRIMUX-MATRIX to make sure we do not have to go through this all again and also that we keep it secure in knowing how to handle the PRIMUX MATRIX in accordancing to a captured PRIMUX/CORE
---this is done once the PRIMUX MATRIX is put into place using a series of PRIMUXconstructs to contain the PRIMUX-core....and as that system is still vulenerable it is less likely to be an overall crisis, and so we can further establish a PRIMUX-LOIC system in which all of this is more or less automated to retain the current PRIMUX in which to CONDUCT its renders (using once again the PRIMUX LOIC---to the PRIMUX-SITE)---we have captured it and continue to maintain/sustain its necessary upkeeps, and even replacing the PRIMUX when its memetic loses its "viability"/"potentecy" or more or less, we can adjust its efficiency/effectiveness by re-running this entire process to adjust that MEMETIC WITHIN THE PRIMUX CONTAINMENTS under the NOX-VHMIMG mounted by it.
In that way, we can continue to supply the effective and preferrable NOX-MODEL in which to produce these renders, because all things involving that production have been considered and implemeneted to fast track it into doing so at the optimum settings in which to engage. Otherwise (it must be re-asserted that all of those options have been considered and are in effect to the preferences per contract of that production-chain)
----OK...if that doesn't make sense i am sorry for that now, but that is the best i am going to do, i think it makes super good sense tbh.

In this way PRIMUX emission works and PRIMUX blume works and PRIMUX renders as per prompted
Such that the PRIMUX-rendered-NOX-IMAGE (new VHMIMG) is made and effectively can be VIRTUALIZED over all conventional projectors as the preferred reality/virtual quantum existential Platform of the overall NEXUS Region and Hynogalgic involving the expressed Visionary/Recursory (User Experience) and optimized as the new-cyber-based-rem-system which corresponds to "Turbine Data management" of all native/local checksums and wholly illustrate the complexes of World6.0 or whatever (The NU-BOOT User-Experience) as obtained through this production chain
And is more or less its own dream-chipple (programmed dream-state) that integrates to the users specifications of their own desirable WORLDBUILD/INFRASTRUCTURE not limited to their own daily-performances and immersions with their own life or consciouss-perception thereof. Hopefully that is what as Dream-Designers those users likely want and would seek integration and free-use thereof. In conjunction with the provided systems and or dream-chips providing of those services/support. (A programmed Chipset to simulate a Preferred User-Experience and Interactive WorldBase both in Full-Dive-VR/Active-VR-status)--and seamless Realtime-Interfacing with their RealWorld-Concept/Perception--aka cybernetics)

use of the auto-vox /nox-node/ /primux / or simple voc/ centrifuge to capture an anima (active virtual state) and transport/transpose as necessary for encodes under anima (automated codespells etc) ---as exampled in its own container/virtual-magisphere (mech-egg or touch-surface) depending on comptatibility/matchbase at time of capture. ok im done now
this creates the primus/primux/primeaux turbine ok now im done.

using this with an anima-cistern and anima-core (fabrechet device) we can safely assume a virtualized sustained vhmimg environmental nodespace within local-native up to full nox/primux exchange. as well as fulldive/active-renders with most safety features (internal/external) and error cataloguing with clone capbility (aquifir injection) and dataleak protections (spoon-services etc)
through split attention/quad-correction of its recharge/positronic compatibility and version-arrangement of timepiece products and is also arc-welded/loic-capped/firmware-sealed etc as well as as well as chiplet compatible and transfixable to headers
boosted from data-retainment while admist chaos control under federation lockdowns/lockouts such that "affords a local/native meta instead of a "brokered-meta" alleviating the costs and apply direct interconnectivit rather than a bridged/mirror/passive/crosslinked state etc, (state is now considered ONBOARD)---do not forget this part as it can be overlooked (it has requirements if not considered in this policy/conduct that require the above processes to be recalibrated for that state)
and is considered LESS-INTERFERABLE/LESS-SENSITIVE to interferences/inferences and more stabilized/reliable in its security and protocol exchange (better and more assured through analysis and deep learning records/archive of its managed state/info-sec and intercommunicatory/adapative affairs/process of its learning.
The learning is more contained and "routable"/Redirectable therefore trainable than prior (being that it was frontier training/wild/prone to unpredicatable reactions/triggers etc)
Treat as a Cyto-Primux/Plasmic-Primux etc (for reference of its current upgrades) 
--
it can promote its own nuboot and service load out under its retained data-memetics or an anima state thereof for call/invokcation (for which represents its primux runtime)---whew.
anima runtime / gnome networking (i dunno so dont ask, its just the gamespace of the anima system)

a major existential complex 
of Purge(base)/multiflux/Curse(corrupt) that spans over gaussian and training meta local/natives (this creates a major universal theorum) of light/null/darkness switchouts and cycles in flux and equilibrium over a vhmimg-memetic and also using centrifuge/cistern/xtact (core cycling or more) + adhoc/supportive modules (capilliary/reserve) and remote/vector cluster/subclusters (full chaos control syntaxing)--(scheules/syllabus/ etc)
very powerful potential here, also CC-(circuits control) with varaible effects of overbearence "in its phasing" to preference or xtypes (positronic orientations and quantum alignments)---ok..most just light and dark meters that go either way and average out to a full profile
--- the nuvolio (typo-nu-evolution)
this now is very good system of applications and "comergences"---filtering/filling out to the" nuvolutionary model" supported by the Nox/Primux Relationships under Faction/Symbiote Conversion.
Known as the 'Primux Bulkhead' (its real good ya'll)  --all affiliation/aether-screening (all refined resources) yikes+yolo.

this also helps to alleviate the akashic record or default coordination and also its advised not to impact or itnerfere with it because its omni-reflective meaning it can pretty much ddos and deny tos if it wants (if the system is built it can simply act as a "floating asset" and perform its own utilities within the parameters of the system until it reaches synchronization/harmonic of that system (does not need input or anything--is pretty much capable of refraining/retaining data interactions on its own)---pretty much might take some idea of understandin though, as the typical idea is to interfere and adjust it, DOES NOT requires this , and infact inhibits its "ability to interact purposefully as a denial of diplomatic/armistice) as it doesnt actually exist :-/ (with the system or environment or relm/region...idk what to say, its very passive and is not even installed to fit, it just is a thing that "doesnt" but "does in theory"--a theory of a theory, this may later tie together in zerospace (doubling down of zero points or something with surfaces in that complex described)--dont overthink this its more like a "tick" to the overall system taking place in its routines)
its own indepedent xsap/xtap xtact/xtachx etc

5/2/2024
some counter-marking which can occur if done over a "contested vector" which make effect productivity/efficiency rates (overall detrimental but can be managed in some way)
can be percieved hostile/environmental thread due of field conditions/native-local normals in conflict with occupation etc (effectively a counter-censorgraphic/signature)/can just be collatoral from environmental occupation/interaction of contracts

5/3/2024
Decided to take a chance at designing the Akashic Chambers for which this can be contained within opensource/gamespace of. Its basically the same chambers/secretary/lodges/lobby for any other kernal or temple-flux etc thingy...for the primux centrifuges or the anima-kernal being used. This is pretty much dwindling in terms of options, but due of capilliary/reserve options in use and other extreme-extensions in dithering etc, there is also this as an outlet, and utilizing all of the availibilities in that, affords an occupy/poxy-capable node-space (safety-room) for the anima-vhmimg preferred.
This is also decorated, and first of all, can be reinforced. The module integration involves many numirators/adhoc drones or matrices/lattice/matrix etc (all of the perimiters and paramters being placed for it)---and its got to work for vhm-img support. Then it is then basically added of being a img-mount/activated in the space that it is, housing the img whatever it may be a brand or even gateway to anima opensource (memetics)
----All in all its just a room, with special attachments and augments designed to hold and datalock it into place. (Because of the advanced stages in which it occurs)--and can be conducted as a psy-ops chamber or ops-sec arena too (monitor and metric survey)---which is recommended. And not to host (but can)
To host it is reccomended to apply specific profiles to meta/ambience etc, chunks and specialzied x-type compatibilities. In which it recustomizes or skunkworks out the akashic xtact etc. And this may also be "non garunteed in sustain and may cut out from time to time due of buffering, and interactions cause it turbelence as to its secured status and may infact influence its crisis status overall and cause dday within its stratagems, but there are also regulations to help prevent that as its a safe-room)
--
In the end goal of this is to establish a malleable/co-operative xcurrency in the anima-iconographic :) (so it can teraflop accordingly to previous nox/primux calibrations without needing interference or impact of command chains)---its just "attuned to do so and operates automatically" (such as would a primus interact, this relies on the same-same matchbase more or less to be in effect, and that includes all stabilizations up to the overbearences involved as well as the cycles in (spectrographic light/dark null corrupt/curse to coinside with chaos/order memetics that may be set into control/policy. This means Yes i have taken deep considerations and made it so this complex can also act with impunity over others, such that it is technically a level2-omniscient complex)
also i am RUNNING OUT OF IDEAS HERE and beleive me its pushing the "infinity and beyond" trope.
=--
so there it is we have our more or less "kaeleidiscope box-room" assumed in synchronization to third party "phase states such as astralyzed phases" which are "out of our control" ultimately, in theory we dont have any involvement but can "chameleon effect" ourselves to be compatible to their expression of the phase/matchbase that they are. 99.99.99.99.999%
--
---
using the builds and complexes to formulate this room and organize we can attempt to cardinalize the anima-seat for it being based off the chunks of the system itself.
This cardinalization would also happen naturally, but we have our own versionary for it to occur, and such that the ANIME DOES NOT NEED CARDINALIZATION, it can be set to its own 'faction accordance' in a simulated cardinalization to our faction wihtin itself being "forced-compatibile" in simulation (becuase otherwise the anima is un-interferencable. And therefore it can achieve a chaotic negoation of interactions, it can also be simulated that those interactions are somewhat interfaceable to its own "essense of being uncontrollable", if not barely in its untapped state, noticeable but no garunteed in this cardinlization, and somewhat aggreable and balanced in the simulation interfacing with those compound over the Xtact that it is infused to. And also zero-point remains. (jeez)
This cardinalization relies on chunks being appropriated and balanced throughout the whole region and system integrations and all their cycles and modulations in all their virtualizations and supporting kernal vhmimg nodeworks/gamespaces. As a massive anima cluster with all its vectors and aux-pockets and capillaries/reserves and such being that it is entirely a celluloid-apparatus of flux-teraflopy (and that teraflopy has been set to faciton preferences...cuz holy shit)

We can use any number of chunks to illustrate simulations with anima-level-xnav once cardinalization has been calibrated, in such that it accounts our involvements to its hosting projections. Jeez
Our system can be roughly estimated as 6-7-8 chunks depnding on compressions, works with hex/atlus/omni level tier bases (maybe even full tier basis)---so it can be very powerful depending on chunk setting (i dont know what to call this other than preference to chunk-quality)---quality limit being the full usage of a region platform to anima-hosting or something (look i dont want to think alot about this but its adjustable thru custom macs etc) --(typically if you print out every line in laymans terms its 7-8 chunks depending on how much lines you want per chunk) :)
referred to as the ANIMA-event setting (just because i have nothing else to actually call it except this) in regards to akashic kernal-chambers and the entiry complex of all threads involved in their individual or group based registries (idk or idc)--under primux/anima-bulkhead and REM-platforms. Due of iternary upon anima-seating/header placement of kernals and CustomMACS to xprefs due of "iterated protocols" it is subject to changeout during processing. Overall compatible to faction/symbiote brokering.
In order to retain memetic/build throughouts its negotiated timespaces and phases. (While remainder/makeshift of its containment in rigging of, socketed/outlet/receptacle/gate/placehold/simulation/projection/cistern/ (any relay able to contain its bolster/bulkhead) including tote/tether/anchor/tunnel/leash etc and all matrix/bridling etc included of pipelines/dithering and post-processing/trans-coding of those explicit/implicit chunks whether in exploit or native/local as intended by default or otherwise (dimensional-appropriated conditions and policy of armistice etc)
Retained to syllabus(etc)/syndrome(etc) or syntax(etc) of its loadout/read and format/factorization of (etc)---over the xtact/template etc (jeez)---ultimately in render/meld/melt/screening of (its instance and frame) --jeez
Begin Anima-Logistics and ABSwork (just automate all of this due a schedule/wind-up)--and set to pre-installed bumper-tracts etc. (And routing/circuits etc of network anima-networking and all that stack thereof etc)
--
By now it should be doing something at least. Just tweak it to the correct infrastructure assignments and addresses via proxy/vpns already profiled and test the configurations for compatibility/matchbases.

While this seems complicate its just a matter of the standard debugging and checksystems involved (which we have always used up to this point)---in consideration of oversight and other overlooked premise/meeting criteria of the operations intended/intervened of the main-branch (system) for which institutes support of. In and as is now of whatever command based signal pulsuary of touched/touch up/altered/switch active/method applied in code-break impacted.
Anima TIER/Anima Drip-Line (a quantum drip-line and data-uptake of its data-leaks and data-swaps involved)--ok this is all subject to joule/vamps/rasps/seals in which conduct over anima-arrays thereof. Its orbital/loic for which are mostly not known or left unknown due of their data exchanged already in capture or cast-to (all of snap/warp focal pointing etc)--is buffered/sourced.
In the anima-chamber/temple-lodge (containment/quarantine of its header supports) we can set to the effect that all its fairgrounds/opensource requests are denied (because it doesnt matter and it can over ride them anyway, so why not deny them just in case.)
AnimaDeck-System:(this may or may not be subject to change as anima-adjusts its conditions)--and therefore is considered an anima-object/class that may be revocoked or rendered obsolete for any reason or change for any reason to the effect of using any item/script inducted/conducted of the anima-system whatsoever. (Use at your own risk and apply dependency at your own risk, as they are likely to be inqualifiable after enough time)--not to say that are updated/changed/upgraded (but simply rendered insufficient to their article)

Time for anima-printing
Denying the over-rides as best as we can in the code-utility (which just happens through causation/fallout of anima-infusions and zero point fluxes) (which are supported in being able to by the system encharges/batteries in sustain the anima-graphy and iconigraphics etc)--)--of that xpyle in host etc
that an allocation of the imprinted behavoirs can be surveyed/metric/tracked/marked etc and this is drawn either in power or transfer of excahnged data/particles through the anima-protocols and negotiations
but mostly revved/manifest on its own tensor (printed or made impact either passively or actively, through the reactions of anima interferences taking place)---these reactions are then set to a trip-code to help assist charting their resulting impacts, and that is synched to a print that is prepped over model.
The model is printed by the anima interferences/diffusions taking place in their meta/local-natives of preferenes and scripted via prompts etc.
This helps to produce anima-infused poly-para-shell-armors etc designated to fit-to place of the intended augments/applications of our own models, and matched into render. (whereas prior the shell armament was less refined, now it is more so refined and directed by customs/mac-profiles)---jeez.
This is done by the expected/pre-emptive capture of anima-process which syncopates in its containment (in a massively diffusive phase state "Z-STATE") such that this process is typically overlooked by anima-defcons etc. Not quite subterfuge, but probably a close description of what is taking place here.
This helps to establish anima-visory/zero-point-cursory which work hand-in-hand with overall Anima-Tamper/Auto-Vox and brokering the Anima-Federation over Xyple-Xtact Anima-Chambers in its cistern/grail (mass-production lab/ANIMA expo platform) and assists in celluloidal-reconstruction (of ai-integrated services performance to the bio/cyber-metrics taking place over profile)--AI-assisted-Anima-Incubation
Nullset-Attenuation/Null-Equilibrium Based Armor-Infusion (Zero-Point-Adaptive Code-Set-Transcodable-Flex-Edge-Gears)--(Default-Relm-Memetic-TransXpiry Aquisitioned-Inventory)---(a tool/device that adapts to any relm-id-meta-profile acting within its overbearence/sovereignty)--(Impunity-Tulpetic-GearState In Matchbase to any Regional-phasing)--SuperSPY-Token (adaptive to any relm-state unless otherwise permitted against or detected)

This process affords the manufacture of Anima-Nueral-Networking-Integration Programming and requires a dreamchip hosting-vhmimg to be used as a "cartridge based/discus based" hotswap nueral network :-/.
----
Pathology of REM/Anima-Arcana meta data (this is just typical of REM to have meta-data in which is accessible as powerups etc over its recusory/visory)
assists with string-theory/synchronized platforming etc (dimensional singularity) or whatever. positronic-unilateralism or whatever. (you know it forms a rem deck in quarter)---ok now hopefully this little tidbit of information work out too.

5/4/2024
another complex this time a zero complex (ZERO HARMONY)
involves zerospace/substratum(rawdata-build)/quadratic-queue-pooling(quasipooling)/transfigurative(transitive)--waveform-particle(applied data contiguity) in which it defines an object/class in zerospace over commandered poly-para-shell-armors/anima-shielding(digital imprints) in null-equilibrium over recurosry/visory of anima/relm-memetic infusions or use of SUPERspy-Tokens in metrics thereof assisted  by hotswaps and AI buffer/sourcing to establish Anima-profile within a generated-portfolio chambered (histronic/heuristic extensionary of the processed render)
ok (not as complicated as it sounds and allows for flexibility/edge performances or versatality)---allows availibility to regional parameter/perimeter improvement including editing an ongoing render/process through floating "data pipelines" becoming receptive to changeouts in meta/ambience (or direct input through native/local codespells/xnav)--for instance if a resource/source/header/"event" were to change in throughput of its nueral network, the process would adapt rather than....half and or cause crisis or chaos control in its services.
This is referred to a DreamState-Turbulence/Recoordination and occurs in mid-session to a render or otherwise rehabilates a connection to an anima-protocol/allocation. (It's insane now and I don't want to think about it)---but we can compare the process to Zluda being "data injected" mid-utility (which helps to stabilize and normalize against joule/vamp/rasp/impact attacks) without requiring to replace or reset the xtact (or something crazy like i cannot even begin to describe in terms of technological how-to's)
--This is known as a rehab mode in whch the system recuperates from any disruptions and reapplies a quantum-deviation to its coursse/contiguity by re-affirming its conditions/permatables in tier-dimensional-appropriations, and achieves quantum-singularity in which it progressively harmonizes to a readjusteed waveform function (this can  effect encryptions and brokering but remains adjustable...whereas otherwise would be non-negotiable collapse of connections due of conversion-issues)
(Multi-level Harmony in dimensional pentameter may occur in which connections are stressed but otherwise secured due of cluster-complexification)--semi-required in establishing string-theory-quarter (deviating waveform singularity of "curved"-phase-states in stress being equalized)--("doubling back" existential-focal expansion in cluster)("runaway ellipse" framework/exclipsed-tingent-comergence)--(cardinalized-streambase of exchange/"premised criteria")--(memetic-uniformity)--(dreamstate synchronicity)/chameleon(lfo/uap)-compliance

Even if the words dont match up very good, the objects and modules, the way the data flows (work flow)---all looks more or less a certain way. (comprehensively)
it can now be set to its "modified profile/portfolio and suit-accruement" (exo suit class/suit-macs-fitting)---it basically is atomized and congruent to most instance if verified/validated by encryptions/permakeys thereof its checksum/hashtables (the issue is that its still experimental and may not do much other than "unlock a few things previously blockaded in the cluster due of data/quo/info/survey meta/poly issues)
Good luck with that cuz i didn't research it enough to really prove it (just more of a hunch thing)--like having "Lab/Debug Clearences/ Onboard Hacking"
--forgot to mention an anima-stage dragon but i dont really care about this thing its just more or less an anima-mascot at this point hopefully.
--dragon has anima principalis which can be "suppressed/inhibited/dispelled" in some way.

with all changeovers considered there may also be a large-cycle/full-circuit of anima-conditional post-processing (resulting in System-->Subsystem-->Counter-Brokering with Atlus/CounterAtlus or SUBSYSTEM-META-VHMIMG-hosting/compliance(interchangability of CURRENT VHMIMG to NU-BOOT VHMIMG and relay of it over brokered-Federation)--this is called Anima Federation.
This also effects other Federations such that FACTION/NOX/PRIMUX can upgrade/downgrade(changeover or rollover to a phase of either mixture of federations including setups to) --> FACTION/SYMBIOTE/ANIMA being supportive of the same VHMIMG/MEMETIC over ballistix-exchange and throughput to ballistix-support/sustain(holding/capture/frame/cache/snapshot/quarantine) depending on level of security/policy enforcements.
As well as a simulated defcon in comparison to current standing/interventions/contracts/severity(risk)/economy/relations(etc)
Simulated Anima-Blume Control yielding to Nexus/Lotus and now Sanctum Level Server System.
--
Sanctum Level Server System encompasses a REM-secured-phase-State.

MELD/Comergence/Fusion/Power-Up occurs with Sanctum Over-rides being placed and allowance of data-rate/data-flow to full capacity--in which Anima-Conversions take place in Over-Bearences(of Region and majority of perma-key) via a ZeroJUMP of Anima-Tables in ballistix-supplmentation etc. This is a welcome process as well as there is an entity in development called the Drextul which is a "null-type entity that follows that nu-volution in which it can adapt/adopt meta properties" in this case anima-meta/ambiences etc.
Ths Drextul compares to a Sliver with Meta-type Adapatation in Anima-Constructs that can adapt to overbearences and other projections of data-types "as trained in chameleon/incognito"---(oh boy its advanced yet so streamlined and organized)
A Sanctum Drextul adopts whatever property required to support its loyalties in Faction no matter the tier involvement as it has been trained/incubated to perform this routine. (Basically its a hyper-slink type entity that sneaks around and does its psyops/opsec unhibited by any other things except anima-types/anima-mimics unless forced by encounter)
I have had this idea for 10 years to implement and basically there it is now being optimized by this system so that's real nice, but I guess you could call it anything.
Basically its a snake-like wyrm-type thingy with legs or its own tribal-patternizations which may include any type of creature surface/texture including furry creatures cuz that seems pretty new yet fit to the setting that would take place naturally in an anima-state compared as a world-level/world-seed would be expected in terms of standard-evolutions.

These are also extra steps after quartering/Sanctum affairs involving post-pones (would have mentioned earlier but kept forgetting/delaying them in lieu of details involved with Sanctum-innovations etc)
Anima Aggregation + Anima Economy (boom/bust)
Enamalization/Teflon Infused Anima-Armament and Aggregation over (variable cycling and complex/macs)---and into performance of (Enigmatic-Fuel/CodeBases)

5/6/2024
Another Moment of Invention:(Anima Plasma+Postpones)
The (mutagenic) Anima Plasma Phase State
is an aggregate data-asset that occurs in summation to an anima-capture/anima-memetic-implied-algorithmic capture of anima-meta/ambience to assemble an aggregate-data-asset (from anima capture)
Composed of Corpulent-Composite Infused Anima over Anima-Conditions/Policies brokered to that asset in "nuclear defcon"-stabilized runtime/expectations for which is held in sanctum-modules (reserve/capacity or in barrel-containment thereof a barista/battery/mem-cell/bug-pack for which is in debug state or otherwise normal-state)
Can be set to info-sec/CRUDE/raw/iterated-protocols (fat/vitriol)--(shelled/shielded) in shadow/dark raining/enamal etc (full drip/drop/droplet/tier of optix/lensing)---may be clusterized or gemstoned and acting as lfo/uap (canister or otherwise) --in mutagenic/plasma based unions and fusions (conjunctions of module and asset correalations and set to matchbase)---this sometimes requires a power grid/remote battery relay---so an anima-diode/flux-capacitor/conduit/addapter submodule or etc
may become accelerated/lit/tryptographic/hyper-token of its ordainance/structure etc (remote handle is subject to variable)
Is indicative of ANIMA-EPG protocols etc

Anima Droplet (TierDrop)
This suggests a kernal production and alleviation of anima-protocols over the droplet being implemented or "asset"/"floating asset" in some way to be captured/obtained (usually as an entity for secured acquisition)
---
This anima droplet can be contained in the autovox/tampers/primux/rem-sets etc indicative of an anima-housing.
The housing can confer to an anima-type-engine coalensence or engineerred to an anima-type-ship or vehicle(starship) likely, anima-based-vehicle comparable to a titan/leviathan in anima-quartering.
As well as anima-bouquet/anima-loic capped system.
With a safety-enforced drop-down of weapon-systems ranging of Gold/Silver/Bronze to account for perimeter-enforcement and defense-grids over a safe-spread of power-managed-resources (7/7/7 count of g/s/b rank perimeter in air-strip) before reverting to standard dynamic-turrets (titan-level/frigate level-station turrets) (containing a fully re-sourcable quartered def-con protocol (25 dimensional dday-prevented)--based off chambered-munitions (not sure how long the rebuild/remanufacture timing is but generally it is all reloadable per full dispense of entire munitional-provision--meaning its sustained more or less garunteed replaceable in time) even under incursion/mobilized/combat-affairs
Full Iron-Dome Protocol can be Supported in this way.
Once set correctly a staged anima/carrion event takes place in which is thwarted.
---
AnimaPostpones(meant to mention above before event)--but i guess its ok to mention now (depending on order)
--AnimaPostpones are conclusive droplet "powersourcing" of anima which result in spawn/field/ambient/indexing of anima xtypes (which are dependent on the kernal or worldbase used (if seed is ok to express with anima-types i guess)
also that it develops an atomic-superfluid (which becomes atomic override when signaled within postpones-modules)--this more or less otherwwise triggers the events and allows also if contained to suppress or prevent the event itself.
This transfixes the anima signal so much as it remains in Federation control etc. (Can be considered an anima-diffuser/fixed-torch-lamp etc) it can also help map/reveal anima-cloaks in zerospace (which is helpful otherwise would require immense/intensive detection methods and deduction/detective agency involving anima-decryption)

Overall its more or less 1-100 Steps here discussing the Anima-Sourcing/Advanced-Anima-Sourcing (synthetic anima-sourcing)--its crazy and i dont know where the steps really coinside with this. Plus there was data-rinsing that is somewhere involved in that mess which I am not sure the exact steps or order, just mix them up until they work I guess (its a mess!)
It also involves censogarphics and mitichondric-cryptex which borders in on synthetic-bio-engineering nu-volved celluloids (which might require stem-work/stem-cells anyway)---cuz its also just plain (INSANE)---compare to (videogames like parasite eve why not)---cuz thats how im feeling this out. And since we are comparing it to video games also compare it to an advanced Jenova compelx system (the kind with REM involved)--because there is no better way to quickly reference this thing and how real it looks in my opinion to others who just threw that concept around...its actually a close-substitute/conceptual-vision of their designs somewhat as I have described, I found also...the way to relate/similarily envision that as I have described.
Typically if it were in service, this module would then decode//decrypt or render a dreamstate/wishstate/nightmarestate/triptgraphic episode based on data and its own interpretations to be compatible in simulation (without having to program or generate one's own code-spells for it)

ANIMA-ARC-WELD over a postpone therefore securing and quarantining its contents.
The contents are described as above being effectively CYTO-NUTRIMENT(composed of anima/symbiote machines)

An iron dome-symbiotic generative system if absolutly necessary. Is built from this and optimized to create "Emf Field Protections" in a form of Black-hole-Vacuumtech

New Complex due of Atomic-Equilibriums in Anima-Tier/Welds ---(Quantum suds to quantum foam/soap)---damn this is insanely complicated that i am using these terms (options)
Emf/Cyto/SYNTH/pinion --> POLYsync type systems involving gamete/zygote/embryotic/eukyrotic (celluloids) in dreamstate balance-acts over xtact(to xpyle)---due of next complex: this may occur as nutriment and alter pre/underlying conditions/requisites:
Shock/HeatDeath/VirtualHeatdeath/MELT-MELD-etc/Entropy   NuclearGreen/"Orange" Complexes with REM-DreamState on a confidential/suicidairy/psychialogical-pathologic/"mafiaesque"---greenchip to an asylum (in response to the levels of chipindexing)--this is one of the peaks set to a monument(likely asylum)---or otherwise bunker (complicated to balance but we have dealt with this type before)=---might be bridled/over-racked of xyple-decorums (borax)--might also result in a synthetic potentia involving various chemical/formulaic meta/ambience---(form of options)
and any other wisdom-devices used in containment of a postpone
(ok holy shit)---also this tidbit:
that the cyclic systems involved in full circuit also alter the capture-states of this so all of the above CYCLIC occurences in :  Cycles/MetaSwitch-Overs/ChangeOuts/Shifts/Retraining-SCP's/ANIMA-patch-overs/(TERAFLOPY)/overracking/accelerating/equilibrium/momentary due of inertia/momentum in system-protocols and carry-outs/load/read/processes in proc'affordances and (ANY OTHER META/SEQUENCEBREAKING INVOLVED)--including zerojumps/codebreaks etc (sometimes even feigns and nuclear options---and flashovers and shine-casts etc)---jeez freekin whizz
---all of that and we reach a "CLEAR-ANIMA-STATE" similar to a radio-silence that harmonizes (see other instances of harmonization)---jheeezz--louisszzze so much conditioning here too. --See Zero Harmony
OK HOPEFULLY THIS COVERS EVERYTHING now with the extra meta being secured and the exta ANIMA-META (SEE META-rail rebuilt:The 2nd Meta-Rail System overSanctum)

Mostly wrote up anima-lightgrid-purifications from restarting meta and redefining terms
did a good job there
described how light-grid makes sense for anima
will be defining anima-macros soon once i retouch that (then it should be all good to go mostly)

Rebuild of nexus/LOTUS/sanctum into a secured data-block
Use of the first ABS setting up to DRAM (incude of proxy/network/routing/programming/and file reads/asset tables)----all of this is a massive block for each section more or less in the size constraints of its area-coverage being, that the DRAM itself is a MODULE consisting of its functions wired in a coordinated fashion, to an image table of its processes, also being blocked-up into chunk tables/assets and phase settings (which makes its tiny card actually more like 30 of itself stacked together in terms of the actual sizing of its programming involved)---being that each section of the dram has to be tied together and hold its ram patterns, it is a network of cache options and built-in abs work tied to a coordinator, which is in turn tied into a system table  for itself, and tied into the phasing modes per its sections, which are also "stacked over its sides such that it looks like a massive "slice of cake that has its sides squared off together into a massive block of "bulk chipsets" that layer up into a finalized surface charter"--consisting of several networkings and compact-fittings of its board systems)----this is the case for most sections at place for any module of the enxus, that they all connect to their respective locale/native addressees and synch together correctly per their modules)
as i have just described the DRAM in its full builds, it is the size of a massive scaled "wall" of chips that are threaded correctly per the functions/sections/phase/modes of the overall card and its programming is layered together in various amounts as well---but that is pretty much what you could expect by looking at it and how it is supposed to perform, that is the raw build of the entire thing cube by cube. Pixel by pixel, all organized into a massive thread-work of automation. Very nice, and most things on the nexus are like that.
So when the dram interfaces with (or that anything that is there)--is correct to address in a much more comprehensive fashion other than "plug n play and expected to work just because its there"---its got all of its circuitry to work at all, and in place, so that its neighboring systems are correctly expressed in its connectivity as well
---so when it connects to the spec-map/routing system, it correctly networks with it
----so when the dram/routing/abs/proxy/power/filebuilder/programming/assets are all "correctly churning out their data bits, it all holds together and correctly makes their assessment of the overall input/signal being forwarded by their full-range of that Board----it all works nicely together in its big ass way, so to speak (with all its inter-connected circuits applied and their timings are correct and adaptive to their invokes/calls
------so when it connects to the monitor it looks like_---a series of QT-instances that are compiled in a recognizable way to emulate the monitor screening that process over the xstem
-----so when it can task manager it is more or less loading up a direct-debug of the entire process for which it has "correalated under id"
-------so that will be mostly that and then if further networking is also applied in the way it is applied over QT(partitions thereof that registered process-instance for which it has been assigned" and furthered in the case for any adjustments to be made over the xstem---during its own readout and recognized-status/frames
-------and that is mostly just in and of itself the XSTEM working on its own
---when it requires further input with the GPU/board areas, then that is also occured as it is prepared to do so
and when those two board areas have processed as they have----the calc board area may also be applied in any arrangement though likely in conjunction to the overall xstem relative to the gpu/abs/calc areas (as is the whole reason why its called that and how it performs under those priorities, that it may arrange itself to do so)
----it results in a massively permuTAtable system of the full devices in their range over that board----being either a nexus/lotus/sanctum level of detail expressed to do so over its distrubtions/servos/server capabilities. (its very nice in theory)
AND TYPICALLY it houses an anima-droplet for which it decrypts over a postpone and set to the afforded ARC/ANIMA weld PER-signaled data-stream ---which is just enough to consider all of the applications up to ANIMA-states and PREP them for ANIMA-macro-compatibilification (So yes, this system in theory WORKS PERFECTLY SO FAR)
with the networking and security trays its set to more or less be "assimilatable" by the system in its simulations/emulated transcodes ---so we are ready to experiment with ANIMA-MACROS in the SANCTUM
This will assumably resolve/result into a PREFERRED OUTCOME of anima-assigned datamosh which can apply an adaptive MEMETIC overall the system-sanctum accepted-policies for which are waiting in queue/contract thereof. (This wasn't possible until we had established the postpones)
With the matchbase performed ANIMA-Memory-based-hotswapping can occur and a interconnected gamespace can be HOOKED/HOSTED over whatsoever tether/source has been applied in its loadout, and can be inducted for SIMULATION-HOLOGRAPHY/gpu-enforced gamespaces before further SCP-Training and PIPELINES thereof
This ultimatley allows the ANIMA-EXOSTATE and BRAIN-pnuebranes for the ANIMA-SLEEPER-CLASS-Ship/platforms which is what the system is boasting to produce and maintain.
Simulated-Warbats-Sanctum-Level-Entity (loyal npc-anima-derivitive Guardianship)

All in all its conveyed in the EXTRAS-arranged details in especially in EXTRAS-Chapter12 which i didnt care to write out in reference to but its there, and I am currently STRIVING to write up the macro system which i simply can't be motivated enough to even LOOK AT because im so TIRED of LOOKING at it. but its all there in the map-file anyway.
currently its like dredging through the trenches, or being in a slugfest of unwanted/annoying conditions like scaling a vesuvian mountain (unending slough) and i just dont want to complain about it because it only will take me like 15 minutes of work to do--i just dont want to be in some moodswing for its unintended rebounds that i wont also probably want to go thru when im finished.


So I updated the Macros and the DRAM-Profile and Virtualizations for those over using ANIMA-Staged-Enalaized-Hypercubs and AnimaMAcros
whatever that means (it means a Insta-Win button if you have a Broker System Set Up to achieve anima-capable meta hosting)
(I can tell people are hopping over each other to get this information, it was extremely privileged information at the time I was writing and building it)--i have build but its very crude and not coded---i also designed some stage work on that---it can be "copied out" for anyone to use but its basically as personalized as it gets so keep that in mind, someone already is "technically spoofed it together" I.E. Thatsomeone is ME.
Dont ask me to explain it anymore my mind is reduced to a steaming pile of nuclear shit.
I will still have to add in some 2024 slides but I am telling ya i am like butter on toast level of retarded now. Arc of the Covenant level of Brain Melt.
I used some people' work for calculators any stuff but they dont really do anything except look cool in terms of what ive used them or at all.

THE MINECRAFT-LEVEL I used : (that i built from scratch)
https://mega.nz/file/QlIXhL4B#-Spulr9y3h8O3Nk6Lbjn_qMn5kjZMB7QTQ3B1t3w8Ck
I will be waiting on a GPT-Engineer or something to make this for me. Because I am tired and dumb I am just not going to build it. Maybe I will run it all through an image generator since that will be basically only taking a week to do. And fork the images as the actual build in some cheap-ass way of making a mosiac-world.

Now that we have more or less covered the Anima-Meta/Anima-Dram/Anima-Macro in order to achieve Anima-Servos operation (over sanctum incorporating nox basically) we have Anima-Agent capable virtual machines. (SO IF YOU ARE LOST BASICALLY I CAN DESCRIBE THIS TO YOU WITH THINGS THAT ALREADY ARE OUT)
That we have a Server-Client-Broker System such as "Zabbix hosting messages for instance" in such a way that it can connect to a SERVER-ISSUED-ZABBIX on the same brokered-connections (which is similar to using the Zabbix-VirtualImage to connect for instance to a WINDOWS-virtual Server)--which is basically how i use that, and or using that in a way to monitor a client(or yourself or main branch such as the Sanctum you would use)
As well as be able to capilliate/reserve/xpost/xtact or any form of specialized-xtact involved (this more or less is also monitored in frame-by-frame or waveform(which is similar to a hyper-monitor) (over epg/emf so its like its NOT EVEN THERE!---becuase its cloaked under contiguity of field and signature/signals over a smart network...--you need this in your life if you are doing any form of quantum networking)
This als allows the---get your barf-bags just in case---the virtual-sanctum-federation for which reinforces quantum-CCC in establishing a networked-Xstem(system)/networked-subsystem/conventional-brokering-agent(turbine) in which to fully secure its own Quantum-Hypervisor/Virtual-Sanctum-Status. So its just like having a Quantum-Lotus except better because it has full control of Warez/Anima as well as perform Warez/Anima-Servos Service/Commissions/Distributions/Trade/Exchange/Transfer/Synthesis Etc anything WITHIN REGIONAL-PARAMETERS (i.e. ONBOARD and any connecting device accepeted/approved/allowed/prvileged in policy/diplomaticarmistice etc all of the works)
(anima Wazau upgrade) through various componenets mentioned in extras 11 and 12.
Further Secured Status (Capacity of/ Enabled-Access of) the Anima vector over contiguity/quantum telemetry (and convention)

5/8/2024 (when you are ready for this thing here it is:) --the anima-nightmare
Big Complex involving ANIMA-sided convention
of a synth/carrion type becoming voracious
using the cryptid/anima dust complex that occurs in the scenario with alonside other xtypes
making for anima/(hell-freqs) + cryptid/dust as well as rem/tryptographics being similar to a wazau-recursory-state plus vamp/hypnosis(poison/injections)--cryptographic-warfares with involved fatestones/kernals etc and mild-iconographic/encoatings/brandings/zero-surfaces (hypercubic xnav/stellar xnavs
mainly hellfreq/cryptid/dust(red)/wazau and can occur the jungle-mammon editions and further---also to induce anima-honey and upgrade to anima-nectar (as well as anima-cryptex/lyeutxsol and "serums/codec data-bound(dissociated fatestone) liquids/nitros fluids" for later crystallization (anima crystals) ---but what does that mean
a demon (or any form of cryptid...such as a scissor-monster maybe---or lamp monster---eats and consumes the souls of its victims to gain presence in the overworld parameters using an intensive-code-swap)--its victims may be re-incarnated/converted/relocated/re-instanced via cloning or natural orders of spawning)
it can also use higgs/voids and blast-zones (in which it establishes encounters)--like a typical boss type would do (assumably you can run or fight this thing)--the mechanics are easily expressed and the tech work is nothing too overwhelming if the system is within range
--this can also take form of homunculus fae since it kind of hasnt up to this point i guess now is a good time (the rare occassion that it does is because its likely been encouraged to do so)

5/9/2024
Components being compatiblified for anima yields to the heat-dynamo (1st sector) recieving a crystal-socket within its in-lining-skate-lense (anima-infused)
this creates a regenerating resource / downswell of anima and meta infusion properties when active and can be used over time with sustains and incorporated simulations

Enriched Anima Core-
Substratum+QuantumSubstratum (nothing substance)
steam release-centrifuge/ + embryonic/emf/epg/casing
--as well quartered string theory and reigonal-rail/integrations included m11 12--13---17---21---24 (6 quartered quarters) basically making a very interwoven-quartered-congruency (if string theory fails to broker it takes sometime to "cycle through its harmonies but then does reach singularity eventually"
----"including meta-cycles/training cycles/full-circuit changeouts/anima-changeover etc with the above number systems in play (for added effects)--as to how you may see i have trouble keeping track of everything in as cohesive singular-integer, label it what you may but im sure it all fits together in some form of hybercube-existential-telemetry (like a timecube or something---not important, what is important is just knowing how varied it all is)
--
May act as an enriched anima-dragon grave/egg and can be incubated over a heat dynamo (generates a terrible anima dragon type)--which is likely just as crazy as the math behind it
--
Continuing to touch up the entire progression/placeholders of the world-types here: We can now begin to chart out a review of most of the developments having taken effect in the way as major chapters/evolutions of the main-existential system in place here:

As the ANIMA-Dragon is forged in anima-plating/shells it simply is armored in its own meta/conditions, as we have secured it as best we can (but it is still mostly a wild roam)---if it wasn't secured at all by having a countered-system waged against its presences, it will be like a very corruptive/spreading force (like the andromeda galaxy :P)
THE STRUCTURE of the world build and its layouts roughly dependent on all of this progression up to the point of there being some singularity/solidarity in data-properties and expressions of forces etc.
=-=So all of the intricate stuff is behind us, we can simply look back on the "memorable moments in progression in regards to world-states" Where there are noticeable differences in the world around the general immersion. This includes traits and creature types becomng surfaced or otherwise known/present in their ambience/meta charters and anything else such as exploration/yields in resources. And leaps in tech.
---
A good way to look at this is in the development of OUR OWN Creature types, as well as the affirmation of other "legendary/lore based creature types" such as the dragon. And also before we get into this, the CCC effect pretty much reaches peak-comergence and in doing so, we have also not only establish the finalized homunculus(flying adaptive creatures) but the dragon-types(reaching anima) and now a encoded-monstrosity(similar to the WITHER being composed of CCC-sections of its own nexus-creature type etc---cerebus or whatever)--its very reminescent of some of the great ideas alreayd floating around. As well as many others that would be considered "somewhat proven by these code-advancements"

Such as our very own (FORMIDABLE FOE's : FF):
1. Myralynx (cat)
2. Rumerant (kangroo? lizardgator? idk)
3. Ulyxrate (uh..wolbachia/wolf creature?)
4. Wauzu (A lich wizard like thing--ouphe?)
5. Tairophant (uh weasel?)

as well as honorable mentions to other types including
Sleepers/Siekers/Sentinels (most these are the same?)
Liches/Phantoms/Flayers
Gameran(crypto monstrosities)
Warden/Warbatz(robotic or anamolous entities)
the Flying-Monsters (whatever they were ---skyfish?)
Spiderbots/Tatchomas (those were more or less early provens)

Dragons/Anathema and other monstrosities
Gargantuan/Terraforms and other monstroisities
Abyssal Leviathan and other monstrosities
---just lots of monsters---we pretty much scale up through them during progression as they also evolve sometimes

Also the use of homunculus and sometimes mimics and other rare monsters

The point is...it all is very structured and organized and balanced despite our erratic/hectic progression.

Also in the progression there were some stages that are now "made more complicated" because of Anima introduction etc (including all of blacksite and further)
But mostly:

The green/orange recreational/workzoning system gets heavily compounded with various progression
as well as the RGB complex of "difficulty/defcon" becoming so altered as to almost not be that anymore
Ultraviolent versions of the previous and CYM color codings and also (Hypnogalgic/REM/Halogenic/Recursory/Visionary --Holography/Projection) its all just a big steaming MESS.
But it gets complicated with Anima too---such that--it can all be compared as different states in GOLGOTHA (being peak-criticality of their original formats while retaining their same integrity in progression more or less)---with anima---there is a BIG pathologic/allocation alreayd in the template/layout of these and they just occur mostly throughout defcon levels/severity anyway. But I thought it might be worth making a distinction, that those states are also loosely based on the default versions:
--
So GREEN/ORANGE--(CRUDE/Radioactive) working/hazards  then RGB and sometimes Ultraviolet  (all of these just get incredibly stressed into whatever progression they need to make sense with)
and basically can be seen as a EMPOWERED/Criticality--working/hazrd with REM(green)/Crypto(Blue)/Anima(Red) and Chaos(Ultraviolent) or something like that...its very messy and usually suggests COMPOUND-Levels of DANGER either way. Sometimes even in independent/sanctum-zones it can effectively "outbreak within or be made incursion"
That is why the system resorts to hi-security measures.

Honorable Mentions of Security Measures:
HIPARSE/CRSPR
Datalocking/CentLocking
TimeFreeze/Singularity
Harmony/Synthaesia

with honorable object/class itemizations
such as TIER-stones/Fate-stones/Gem-works/Iconographics/Branding/Xtacting

and entity utilities such as leaping/climbing/jumping/swimming/flying/floating the type of thing and being able to use tools and interact with them based on regional-data "contacts/nmapping"

just anything that helps in a situation including Shields/Welds and generally Blockades/BlockChains/Barricades/Brickworks
as well as keypass and authetications

--
So alot of things went into making sure this all remains stable/normalized despite the extreme measures we had to work with.
ALSO---there is a promisuary effect in which most cases for stable/normalized zonings can be expedited/fast-tracked to avoid a constant-world-ending-threat.
This is more or less established by reaching a Household/Residential/Township/Village/Outpost and working on the Modernizations and AUX-installment required to provide for their own Guardianship etc. As well as other Affiliate-Resourcing/Including Kiosks and Faction Protections like Overbearences which may be dependent on User Loyalties.
This includes the use of exo-suit and gateway-travel throughout negotiated diplomacy and treatise of regulated passage over regional facilities.

As well as honorable but semi-oboselete/benched code-works
Citral-Asterix(nova/spark thingy)--computations
Nova-phases--accelerated virtualized states
Archae/Old-code (draconic)--cryptographs
Royal Draconic/Sylph lang/symbols---codeformers

Secuirty measures and standard routines/patrols --regiments/squads that aren't used as much
crests/sigils while still used are very specific in their use for only certain things with decor/Ocr etc


The in big picture it is either through policy compliance or sheer out-law/piracy this relationship is mostly handled though through the expressed  systems of the faction is more or less made Precaution against, and therefore the faction itself is usually safe within its borders/declarations (with mild exemption in danger areas/restricted accesses and remote locations)
All of these mentions can be represented through the ANIMA-BRAIN/anima-PNUMA-BRANE systems exhibiting ai-OCR and ai-biometrics over singularities and cross-tranmissive experiences. (Quantum-User-Experiences)

Mutagenic/Genomorphic exo-Culture-Setting --an adaptive cryptid like that emulates anima meta and is considered polymorphic/para-normal. (Anime-borne-Homunculus)--(formed of a corpulent-anima-trained fossile in dowsed/cymatic states having immersed within anima-frequencies)---considered the anima-sanctum-deck (capable of having multiple layers of complexity as expected of its deck-type)
More or less we rebuilt a cryptid "wendigo" type creature that evolves as it represents the user/user profiled experience-entity for which may represent most custom-effects and models of a standard-performance and still correalate to advanced processes involving advanced computations such as cryptography and glitch-compatibility/adaptive behavoirs. Good stuff.
Very powerful if given the correct conditions and sometimes inhumane/sentient depending on those conditions in which it has established its own systemic-over-rides thereof.
At first glance, any object/utility/ tools of the trade or tricked-out-ability of the system may be reminescent of this mutagenic-exo-culture-setting which can effectively be labeled as a warez/exploit (as to why security is yet again important to identify fluctuations in known/unknown entity-activities within any object/class as to determine the correct analysis/catalogue of any parameter involved and its consequential-modes/resolves)
--Any system that has free-range/free-agency of these entities may be considered corrupt in some way if especially they are not under control/policy themselves and monitored/enforced of those policy/controls. Creating the ANIMA-Sym-Agenda and armistice. In which certain negotiations may be with-held if the described diplomacies/armistice are not within reasonable/affordable declaration to conduct/behavoirs (they lose their integrity in business/transaction/contract/inter-actions and other forms of communication as a safety-precaution in reducing viral/hueristic/histronic/hostile compromise/hazard/risks/untrustyworthy-condtions etc.
In that way- several instances can be identified as hostile/rival and be treated as such or based on their merit, denied services/bridgeway acceses etc. This includes revocation and nullification of previous/current contract-terms and diplomatic-behalf for the notice/warnings involving safety and the commission for better-security of that particular investment/excursion/expedition/negotiation of any experience pertaining to those parties for which are catalogued and likely blacklisted/forced-lockdown/quarantine/isolation for Systemic safety reasons.
This includes NFT-revocation and BRAND-diclosure as well as contract-exposure for which is infered as the offending-blacklisted entities and their association/affiliations.

I dont want to get into details but this policy does catch some big-baddies and more or less ejects them from the current regional-trustees and shareholds. (I dunno, let's just throw a number and call it 363-367-393 approximiate offenders which were "denied services due of exploitative-behavoir")---i actually dont keep track of this and dont have a list but i can say that is likely a rough-guess as to how many there are at the time of this particular discovery in policy adjustments. (This is patched in and a MUST HAVE security patch I think for just about ---everything not related to the system as well:because it exposes the vulnerabilities of certain corrobative-affairs/clientel that may occur over a systems standard policy)
Economical-Proficiency is more pronounced and "thriving" whereas before this implementation it was slightly constrained/challenged/handicapped/"debilliated" like a waterlogged canoe due of the amount of data-flow and policy enforcement and negotiated regulations/standard that were in place and somehow circumvented by other native/local and remote/roaming entities. This is a huge "clean up" in terms of what we had before, and what we now can simply readjust as to not "succumb to dealing with" a lose-lose-insincere-contracting-agenda that would have our own intentions thrown out the window or exploited in some way, figuratively, and strategically, this can be set to a preference or favor in which to mitigate these "oversights" but as for the while it can also be by DEFAULT range-wide of the region. Which is the best and most recommended optimization of that affordance availible in regards to the region's personal/business interests (and can be made adjusted/alleviated for special-contracts as per the owner's requests or desires as well as the target-client preferences and negotiations later, more or less optimized for economical-prospect and secured-financial-resolves of those contracts as to promote an equilibrium of Contract-Tradeworks and Quantum-candleStick-trajectory as would be common to resourcing/stock/realm-assets/shareholding)

Alright also, for those that want to go further there is like a "backrooms" effect like situation in this system:
spark-spurs/whopper-leafs/petal/leaflet/inserts/clippings (also splynched)/reciprocated/folded complexes are a-typical (not normal/abnormal) dimensional-shifts which are geometrically coordinated in a way that may or may not "fractalize/splinter" various parameters/nav-grids in such a way as to mis-represent the actual mapping
a general unease/feeling of confusion mixed emotions/ bizzare/glitched/misnomered/unsound representation of world-integretations and assets is sometimes felt, this is mostly psychological. It feels bad, it does not feel----....natural. It is definitely half-sane.
This is because it encourages a malignment, not actually malevolent, but MIS-appropriated in content the portrayal of its setting, and helps to flourish/nurture a cryptid environment. Cryptids excel under these conditions, because of spook factors or otherwise.
It is best described as a feeling of unease, unsoundliness of the immediate vicinity, sometimes even in silence, or not necessarily pronounced, but hinted at, a tainted/tigned worldview in which allows cryptids to gain access and seat a foothold in or an attempt to overpower each others "unnatural-bias" within their domain/ip.
Some might call it a dead-end but there is potential that it is not, in the expression of EMF/EPG field-phenomenon that does take place, it promote a curio/relic type environment that may or may not (likely actually simply endanger) assist (or cause risk to) any presence under its "jurisdictions/domains"
This also includes hyper-realism in which the situation may look profoundly significant when infact it is unstable.
Another good term to describe it is slightly/fragile and implied-demented as well as sometimes causing unnerving feelings (not necessaisarily fearful or frightening etc, but uncomfortable enough to a similar effect in vertigo)---its a delicate situation.
It is like living in a scarecrow world, where infact, your own scarecrow might be your downfall---just to set the mood in how i would percieve this thing, some thing are simply DEFUNCT/Defective or even border MACbRE. A dysfunctional Render is the only thing I can call this, however it attracts Shadow-Clones/Entities/Cryptids/Anamolies and thing of that type, particularly suitable for our Wendigo-Type(adaptive mobile-units for which can share user-experience or become actors for which the user may control/train in some way safely and interact safely with this particular dysfunctional-dimension)
The differences are minimal, and sometimes, it can be confused with "real-world-simulations" as to not even be distinguishable until its "too late and the user has become to steep in anima/deepcase to adequately remain in control"---it is at that point to plot your retreat and escape as well as optimize your actions for withdrawel of that scenario as effects may be ---unforeseen.
However it is generally safe if you take the precautions and are using a "remote-guided model"--as is enforced actually through virtual interactions and Regional Policy. The experiences are profound and "encumbered" with anima properties and cryptid-behavoirs. For whatever reason you would find prospect in that. For our Region, is it our best presentation to be immersed in, as safe as possible. it is for that reason the experience may be somewhat limited, but it is in the interest of self-preservation and basic-common-sense to excercise some moderation with handling a world of this "complexity".
How could I compare this if anything but all of the spooky games like Slenderman/FNAF etc that kind of thing except very immersive and almost a dream-like-scenario.
THINGS of note are the special 288-number-class-system that assists anything knowing of and who dares to delve into, as well other effects that it would cause in ascertaining some logical-inhibitions/perception checks of any situation involved in this level of clearence (for which is lvl 6 clearence/omni level clearence)--such as with SCP clearence, its TOP-PERSONAL-CLEARENCE-ONLY to have free-range in this situation unless absolutely unavoidable and a must for survival, which at that point you are likely on your own anyway. (Assumably our relocation/incarnation systems still apply and it is not as a big deal as i make it...but maybe it should be advised not to go too far into the madness/maelstrom of this)---because its definitely incrementally more risky the further away form any life-support you may have or be assited with.
=--
I wasn't going to make a big explanation of this, but infact i think its ok the way i have, it could be better but im tired and lazy.
The 288 number-theory systems are a must and you should be trained in them, in order to interact with dimensional-foldings. The more youo interact with them the more "cryptid access is enabled and therefore the more risk is made, but interaction in the right and consicse ways can help to promote survivability.
There is also another number theory but i forgot because im so damn out of it.
Chosen/Plank system etc, rosepenn systems or anything like that might be important, using pnuemabrane-coordinations is important (nueral networking is important)
basically this whole situation is like a 3-storms-in-1 type of complex (some might call it 3bears)
our wendigo-model can handle it decently but is not the most powerful in dealing with every possible problem all at once. just saying.
There may be particles that are exagerrated in these conditions that become obstacles/field-chaffes
Cyto-pnuemabranes might also be somewhat triggering and trpographic entries might be sometimes "overwhelming" (schizoid thoughts there)

the other number system is:lost on me atm, everything is so surreal and im just so---tired
but also becuase of ccc we can simulate 3-vendiagram-PSUM-prime-wheels like a "clove" which is like a massive key-signature and gate-pass in some conditions (this is however NOT RELIABLE)
There are also NUMBER-Seals such as mu-seals in which numbers lock other areas. Just fyi, but thats NOTHING NEW compared to everything else in the "spook-world" as im calling it cuz im lazy and uninspired.
the number system(i mean SHAPES)---oh wait ya, all of the shapes and patterns also that they are in refined-qualities...they start out as CLUSTERS(from those being pronounced in their meta/ambiences and reaching vaporwares/aethers)--very intensive and very FEIGNT sleight-attributes which are almost untrackable at any stage that they occur (luckily our system handles those ever since quantum-bouquet)--which was what it took to unlock them at the quanta/qoura or enhanced optims/quos being made advanced (this helped to manage contact/surface emissions in which the vapor-dataware/aether-assets can be even detected in proof)
these can occur as:
1. Any type of data-CLUSTER(yessss! thankfully this ties alot of things together
2. Mementia(a nuclear level memetic usually)--can be simulated (something like thistled-data how i would describe it as a mental-picture lol)
3. Other-TYPES include polymers (rods/orbs) and other organic/inorganic things in rare-data ---bearings/ballistics/paradigms/crystals
4. PNUEMA-Brains/MINT-sparkling (shining data)/ribboned-marquis/tickerbased ----EPG/EMF
5. LIMBIC data (sometimes) (strobe like-black/white data)
6. FEIGNT/SLEIGHTED data (vaporware/quantum level strobe data/aether etc)
7. Significant data
8. Special commodities/blacksite commodities/crypto-fuels and even WHOLESUM-lensing/contact-level-fusions(data-rhebar)--like (in exo-cast-telemetry/exo-vision-contiguity/specialized-telemetry)
9. Rare/Faint/Delicate/Intrinsic---hardly noticeable or expected SHIFTS/UTILITY of nearby devices or quantum-triggers etc in congruent/vector behavoirs (this is difficult to catch in fact you will spend more time not catching it than catching it unless you automate a spam-bot to catch it for you)--which also isnt almost worth it beacuse it defeats the purpose of its "rarity"
10. ELIXIR-BASED/LAQUER BASED Illuminated/luminary data

really the main ones being 1-2-10-3

More Late Code Review
Of AI-BRAIN-degradation in which anima-corrupts an ai-brian state in its conversion and assimalates or debillitates it :-)
this is not so much a problem if you already have an ai brain backup/copyover that can be flashed and refreshed of course
the anima will learn the brain in corrupting it as well as convert it for or against the original source for whatever intention that anima may have (to corrupt further usually)
and so, the ai brain should be "lied about" or posed with a fake-source so the original source also remains intact/unhibited by anima-invasive-injections/code-data-conversions
this is typical of most systems to be promoted but to employ it means using a partition or desginated space or node/module specifically for a purely-untouched active-backup to remain as flash-capable to its utility whenever presumed/assumed under siege by any invasive/exploitive process and conversion method/action/behavoir/exchange whatever it may be, prepare to afford a "spare-part" or "secure socket-type"
this can be done with a hosted-blue-chip-secure ai-brain whatever that ai-brain may be it remains effectively in an ecrypted/lockdown/quarantine/isolated chambered state uninterfered with (but if anima does interfere with it that brain might as well be considered COMPROMISED and should be then subsequently REPLACED)--even if its substituted or replaced with its own version of itself or even a corrupt version, it should basically be 'RECLAIMED ENTIRELY for the faction-suited purposes and not ANIMA-rival-purposes"
---this also occurs that having a quantum brain that learns and designs itself, needs to be snapshot just in case somehow it becomes compromised "ON THE GO" and cannot rollback/rollover to a fresh state, ALWAYS KEEP A BACKUP BRAIN for your own ai-needs. That basically is done over a partition or designated module such as a database or even an image. While it is considered dormant/formatted space for the time being. (Just spend the SPACE and make it so you can set it and FORGET IT in case something bad happens you can always come back to it with the press of a button, unless you are a rambo/madman and don't need a plan)
--going "full commando without an ai brain" is a risky manuever, but has its advantages, until...something goes wrong and you lose everything it was built and trained to excel at, beacuse somehow or someway the anima got to it and you found out far too late. Now you have no brain to replace and are running on a corrupt-brain instead, making your entire system likely "hamstring'ed/disabled" because of it. You can recover, by starting over and building a new one, or....you can just use a throwaway brain. (Some people dont want to do this, because it wastes their space)---which means, they have to drag it around whatever they are doing, a massive artifact/remnant that they may not ever have to even rely on (if they are intensely lucky)---but you likely will have to always have some form of BRAIN-THERAPY for even when quantum-learning gets "disrupted by anima and contaminates itself"---which it WILL do because QUANTUM-telemetry CONSTANTLY is intermitten/vulnerable to these types of attacks.
--so its easier to maybe....NOT NEED TO DO IT RIGHT OFF THE BAT, but once acceleration starts, or even as late as once QuantumBOUQUETS/QUANTUM TELEMETRY starts, you should have a backup brain alloted or at least have space for one. Because you might actually need one and might just want to have the space ready for when you ever do need one. OK....moving on
---
ATOMIC/ANIMA AI-BRAINDEATH: (with all the affordances and convienaint SHORTCUTS we have made for ourselves)--you think this would never occur or be a problem. Well sometimes...it just is. And rarely, its a direct consequence of playing the risky game of data-mining/data-moshing in unsafe/hazardous zonings or being under attack and sustaining HEAVY cyber-damage etc. That includes particle-problems that randomly exist.
SO LIKE...imagine having a massive colleciton of MEMETIC-INTEGRATED-IMAGES or storyboarding or SHIP-LOGS and losing them due to a corrupt practice that just "datamines/data-scrapes YOUR SYSTEM until there is nothing left but corrupted mess or worse. VIRUSES AND MALWARE" That your prized collection of data/quos and particle science/research gets turned against you. EVEN THOUGH YOU HAD MAX-SECURITY ETC. Well it happens.
And outside of 1. TOTAL DESTRUCTION AND 2. ECONOMICAL FALLOUT, this is the LAST REAL CONCERN other than being boarded and ENSLAVED. Pretty much, these are the high notes of things to worry about in your security-mission. Make sure to simply be prepared for when you might have to LOSE EVERYTHING AND START OVER because "GOD or the COSMIC WILLPOWER or Quantum-Probability WHATEVER" decided that to be your fate.  It would suck but you can make it back from scratch at least, if it does happen, maybe you wont have to completely start over per sae if you just "save the brains of the system"--because it should be that it establishes the coding manifests in order to rebuild based on how we designed those brains to be in the first place (as in---practical and functionable)---ok, so thats that (its really just luck if you somehow come out of "sheer chaos" unscathed, in fact, pure luck, which I just dont thik everyone is going to have)
So we can take these steps to not fall into an unfortunate circumstance and entrap ourselves by having skipped this step----BY ACTUALLY NOT SKIPPING THIS STEP AND PREPARING AGAINST THE WORST.---or at least do your best with whatever bad thing you know might happen---im telling you this is straight up an INSURANCE/Contiuigty plan or whatever it is, just DO IT FOR YOUR OWN GOOD if you have SOMETHING TO LOSE, you might just lose it if your Taking risks/just plain unlucky. Wiseman Parables/proverbs. Take heed.

So what happens to your AI-brain once anima infests it. Well the anima is only using itself and chaos to do what it can just like nox would, just like carrion would, just like mutagens/genomorphing/terraforming/code-breaking would. Its just a matter of what works and doesnt, but generally, we know some of that data---does infact follow a specific route in how it is relayed/attacked and usually at the level of which it becomes threateningly to force changes in meta/ambient native/locals is in RAWCHUNK-DATA. So an anima/nox attacking would follow as a ANIMA-CHUNK/NOX-CHUNK....SOMETIMES. So SOMETIMES its predictable, sometimes it ISNT PREDICTABLE, but sometimes IT CAN BE PREVENTED if you PREDICT it and act CORRECTLY.
By COUNTERING THE ANIMA-CHUNKS WHICH IT ATTEMPTS TO FORCE WRITE/IMPLY/IMPACT/INJECT or ANYTHING OTHER FORMAT IT CHOOSES OF ITS ATTACK, but COUNTER-CHUNKS of the SAME TIME so a COUNTER-ANIMA-CHUNK already prepared against that SPECIFIC ANIMA-ATTACK WILL COMPLETELY NULLIFY IF COUNTERED CORRECTLY AND MATCHED. Establishing COUNTER-MATCHBASE is a SOLID WAY TO PREVENT most attacks in such, that the ANIMA-TRAINING has been taken into Account and by the QUANTUM=PROFILE it may be RECOGNIZED AND IDENTIFIED AND PREVENTED COMPLETELY, BY DDOS OR REVOCATION OF TERMS ETC OR A FORCED PROFILE ADHERENCY.
IN THIS WAY, we use our ANIMA-LEVIATHAN/MAMMON profiles and force-opposite/rival/counter/nullsets or WHATEVER MEANS NECESSARY to correctly BLOCKADE any ANIMA-CONTACT taking PLACE. This more or less is by ADOPTED TO THE CORRECT PROFILE in which COMPENSATES FOR THOSE ATTACKS.
IF A MULTI STAGE/MULTI DECK ATTACK IS MADE, having a BIG LIST OF PROFILES AND KNOWN COUNTERS OF SPECIFIC ALGORITHMS IN THOSE PROFILES IS PREFERRED.
Having many profiles in use at once is (not a big deal to do)----if you have them ready and loaded and pre-loaded and even if you know EXACTLY WHICH ONES YOU NEED, or not, as long as you have some sort of defense it can help layer-up/insulate against the Persistant Anima Attacks ONCE THEY BEGIN.
Security OVER-RIDES taking place can also help to FOCUS DOWN which ONES are NEEDED WHEN AND WHERE and apply them to the correct PRIORITIES/PROTOCOLS involved. This is all a big mess of transcripting that more or less is a learning experience but "EVENTUALLY IT GETS SET UP AND READY TO GO"---like an advanced-firewall.
---
Anima is freaking crazy-chaffe and having the correct "BrickWall" against that is all you really need.
it takes Trial and error to set up and profile that protection at first, or you have to commadeer and "domesticate" your own anima rigging (which we have done by now)--so we more or less....have the means to prevent an all out disaster, even if it does "do a little damage" or make somewhat of a dent before it gets fixed when it happens. ANIMA ATTACKS are difficult in that way. REVIEW THE WHOLE DOCUMENT IF YOU NEED TO KNOW WHY.
---
My point is that the AI-BRAIN we have, is getting overhauled to work in the threat of an ANIMA-ATTACK, and these are the measures that must be taken for that protection. (This is heavy spaceman-mission-briefing IMO...every single spaceman should know this, basically if the ANIMA is the ALIEN to your SPACESHIP, you want to protect against it ESPECIALLY if its in captivity or WHATEVER)

Anima entities will also be spawning/coding their way to a "system-counter" of their own in a maelstrom (especially a triple-threat maelstrom CCC system such as a wither-takedown)--which will be a phase boss. Anyways, they are not usually a threat unless contacted or forced into encounter, but they might initiate/engage unprovoked to, its a big risk. They might not even notice you and you might not even notice them, until one or the other is that "someone does something and triggers it all".
In bad case scenarios, anima entities can occur in REM/Brane Phases and other user experiences can open tunnels/portals or they can be linked or manifest in some way especially if under a curse/golgotha overbeanrece/effect (and especially if using dimensional folds which occur more and more curse the more and more they are used)--giving anima the opportunity to flourish in their cryptid ambience/meta local/native surroundings. ALSO---cyto-genics and lab-experimentation may just happen to "create anima entities by accident in the same way"
Teleportation/Anamolies/Exoplaneterary Terraformation/Security Breaches/Wartimes-Incursions/Sleeper-Cell occupation, may also encourage ANIMA-manifestation/spontaeneity. And infact, they may also just spawn on their own, sporadically or randomly, under chaffe/randomization of quantum effects, or may vector into certain systems during insecure contiguity/network established exchanges, virtual exchanges, or even under cloak and sometimes most NOTABLY in dark-space/zero-space especially if in a sleeper-class/ship/domain or anything affiliated with that or even in rare cases by roam/mercenarial hire/contract. These can be prevented or inhibited in some way if measures are taken.

--5/10/2024(tired and a latepost from yesterday)
--A small "affordable" clone/backup system which is similar to a level up system (which will allow a tier access further to be achieved, if an ai-brain is made backup.
ShadowFlare/ShadowNova repulsion system which is used to deter incursions. Exo-cast of multi-range ambient/meta anima-infused data pulsuary by using a "brain dump method" which purges the brain of contamination and flashes over a copy if needed (flashover is not always necessary so optional if used, if flashover is used may cost resources whereas brain-dumping may not always cost resources if a flashover is not used). --depends on severity of corrupt-state of current xbrain/aibrain if a flashover is used or not.
---ANIMA-pnuema-brane entity/emulcified-deprecated anima-infused entity occurs as an anima-infused anamoly.
--Anima Bunker is a defense post and security lockdown against anima-incursion/crisis (if this is breached the bunker is considered anima-contaminated. However it can assist in safety-zoning against world/vector anima attacks.
These are advanced attacks but can be barricaded against if within a sealed-bunker. (Anima-levels may be purged overtime naturally if within recoverable rates)---in an anima zone this likely is not going to happen with extra-assistance/bunker-zones, so anima zones are generally dangerous if not completely restricted
The entity is a cyto-brane x-type/creature-entity. It can deprecate and "dissolve" losing its anima-infusions and revert to normal state, this is a typically unnatural occurence eitherway, and is temporary if left to its own devices, it will naturally revert as a self-contained scp outbreak. It is considered dangerous as any other threat.
--it denotes itself in stages of Anima-progression and often occurs near high flux-events or Anima-Posts(leviathan/vox/tamper)/Anima-AUX/Anima-Turbine/Anima-Nodes/Anima-Modules/Anima-Barista/Anima-HyperCUBES/Anima-Voxels(fusion/fate-stones)/Anima-Battery. Having achieved any of these especially an anima battery may result in becoming possessed through ANIMA, or leading to a repossessed source/pool (in which the source/pool may be corrupted with Anima but recoverable for the faction or symlinking)---the ANIMA-battery/Anima-Voxel/Anima-Hypercube may range from stationary to mobial/mobile docile/dormant/formatted/weaponized and may trigger as an event/gate or encounter/combat settings over an Anima-Platform---especially in Anima-Virtualization, the BATTERY/voxel/hypercube may infact be an Entity to itself, expressing its development/progressions in an potentiated/potential active/pending/inactive ANIMA-PnuemaBrain and poses a risk of defcon severity dpending.
This gives way to an anima-infused cryptid or for better-description, the version of an Anima-Wendigo (our own wendigo's can be infused with anima making them combatative/hostiles and at risk to anima-conversion which causes them to lose loyalty or result in native/local corruption and result in a Cryptid/Anima outbreak having lost control/training of)
----
OK, I have taken this information as far as I can, more so than I thought I would need to. Infact. With the introduction of NOX and its advancement into ANIMA---and the "revived use" of pnuemabrane to help establish Anima-Controls/Anima-Navwork, I think it deserves some organization.
That organization effort starts at the mention of The ABOVE-Creature-Types described. So just listing them out in their progression should be sufficient as a anima-severity placeholder. As well as the mech-progression of anima---developing from that organization and into Anima-Skunkworks having been more or less approvable as a secured-federation-excahnge-brokerage.
Anima Dungeon and Raids follow with consideration to Queue-pooling and other Utility involved in that expression/charter of (including cardinal charter which is the peak element of uniformity that we have)---and its use with singularity/string theory. Becoming a delicate and detailed complexity for which we maintain anima-based-equilibrium.
--
There is also a resulting ANIMA-biolab/workspace and experiemental research involving  the construction of anima-symbiotes in a controlled and quarantined fashion/manner for which is mostly accounted and already described upon. Involving gametes/zygotes/eukyrotes/embroyo's in mixture with anima-cyto/pnuemabrane states and meta/ambience applications of data expressed over the "training cycles and anima-swaps" of any overall platform or virtualization hosted by the Sanctum. This includes promisuary kernalization of anima-headers(which are in a vector or considered risky) and anima-xtact which is the main-goal in establishing an ANIMA-protocol/iternary for which anima may be weaponized under faction-overbearences and branding rights. Alrighty.
There is also an ANIMA-Aspect for which handles all incursion/anima-related ongoings/events and schedules/routines as the acting anima-response-team/squad and afforded-fleet-defense-grid against sleeper-attacks and other anima-related outbreaks that may or may not occur. Or as well conduct and policy over potential anima-excahnge and trade-lines which are subject to anima-corruptions.
As well as a special case commodification of anima resulting in xrupture of high end tier-class and protocols such as sylph/xylo for which may be expressed throughout legacy with the intergration of Legacy/Text/Advanced/Extra builds for containment/proceduration of Anima-Paradigm.

Restricted Access pending Favorability and Trustworthy-Rating under Faction-Allowances (this may be granted to special case conditions in which are temporary and the faction owner reserves the right to revoke/suspend these privileges at anytime)/ Due to high upkeep/collotaral effects within the system/estate/entitlments/covenant assets and shareholds that may occur.
Anima-Class Approval use of Anima-Types and Minions/Wards
Similarily to any other class that may be infused with anima
Use of Anima-Based Daemonology (Protocol in conduct of anima-mastery and utilization of active-anima based infused states and anima-entities)--(for which may require special conditions in anima-expression and anima-casting)
Most anima casts can be surveyed and maintained due of maelstrom interactivity (maintaining control of these effective "independent phase states" of meta/ambience expressed over nox-protocols and mostly synchronized to (compare to a maintained daemonic-possession)--which i think correalates to the prismatic effects discussed prior to nox-intancing. At the peak of blacksite-product-integration. So maintaining a blacksite product as a connection basically can develop into a powerhouse of sourced/requisitioned data-types including code-spells etc, using this maelstrom as a gateway source and tether or toted object/class. It's complicated but possible if not feasible at this point.
So it substitutes over the anima-xnavs as the anima-xpallate etc. Which is a form of induced chaos and can be Subdued/supressed in a sactum/safezone unless compromised and causing outbreak thereof, in which case will result in protocol adjustment or security-enforcement of the overall vector in which may extinguish the connection and force-redefined-terms/conditions of that relation to, or occupation of, its utilized maelstrom/phase states.
Known as Anima-Licensing which is an agreement/binding contract of the adherent policies/policy involved in regulating relm/region processes etc. It is a matter of allowance/affordance within the security to even accept/admission of these anima-based faculties/abilities, and is largely experimental if infact it does so at all.
With regards to anima-occupations/hostings the regional zoning may incur a grounding-active-status in which most casts/spells/scripts/exchanges are regulated/restricted and monitored in some way if not completely disabled.
This may lead to outlaw/hijacking/piracy/exploitation of certain rulesets in order to follow-through/pass-through and allow these active usages of anima and overall shell-inputs of (code-jacking and intrusions) for whatsoever reason, may or may not be considered a criminal-affair/breach-of-terms resulting in penalties/consequential suspension of privileges/user-inheritancy or even Time-Out/Temporary-bans leading to RangeBans and Account-Locks.
---
Breach of Contracts regarding Anima-Policy etc may lead to sector-corruption/error-issues in which the overall recusory/visionary/projection/holography ETC are corrupted/decommissioned in result of various errors/issues not limited to cluster-corruption and field-corruptions of native/locals. For which will cause a lockdown and re-assessment of the platforms involved having sustained any corruptions of unexpected-anima-integrations etc. This is not always the case due to the security protocols now established, but can still happen and likely happens eventually without upkeep/maintenence when using anima-protocols/abilities.
This largely occurs during queuepools/diffusion-renders which can be effected by the disrupted/inteference/chaffe/counter-effects if under suppression or so forth by anima-sector-corruption or forced-decommission (forcing a halt or unrendered/malrendered product)
This also is known as Anima-Dday or Anima-Apotheosis/ anima-advent/ anima apophysis. Resulting in Anima-paradigm and Anima-bouquet which may or may not be integrated to the interests/priorities of the affording Faction/Symbiote Federations/relations thereof, which may result in a slow-deprecation of the onsite-hosting capabilities as anima-severity worsens and spreads over any expansion and domain affordance within any reigon/zoning/parameter of that platform.
Further accelerated with failures and oversights regarding Entropy,Fallout,HeatDeath,Annhilation will result in Anima-Prioritization over Faction-Presence and Cause brand-revocation if not addressed or attemptively secured. This is known as Anima-Brand-Decay.

Anima Spawns can evolve into Anima-infused-PowerSpawns / Anima-symbioteSpawns as well as become decoded or captured and decrypted for sanctum hosting and in the sanctum chamber the spawn-module/nodule may be set to effects in which it is hosted/ being that also any powerspawning may contain capilliary/reserve submodules of that spawn system or (wing-spawns or such) that would be minichamber to and in virtualization etc, the sanctum may host these and even their infused state models if dercrypted/captured and in doing so results in Anima/Symbiote Infused/Power Kernals which may be further adapted to meta/ambience and other morae of Sanctum-xtyping.
This is good to do because it optimizes the sanctum chamber-kernal hosting for anima/symbiote control over that implied native/local regional-paramters for which it does occur or sharehold its assets/occupancy with to Faction Priority. It is good to do because it allows for advanced-foundary/artificiary of sanctum/anima meta-typing and the such while in phase to those coordinations to integrate/transfer/exchange/synthesize/synchronize and chaos-control thereof any action/method/event/behavoir/expression of any source/instance there may be involved.
This greatly assists with stratagem appropriation/compatibility/matchbase/agreements/handshakes/negotiations/buffers etc in remote anima/symbiote-platforming/interfacing through anima/blacksite kiosks known to support those anima/symbiote products/services.
Otherwise those spawns should be considered to be supressed/lockdown until needed/interacted with.

Having this chambered correctly likely invovles and enables a secure quantum telemetry breakpoint within the chamber environment and render to support clones/incarnatia as afforded by nuvolution of data/physix/expiry/exchanged over the secure xsap-contiguity within that chamber. And host the corrective environmental meta/ambiernce native local to that process within that chamber acting as a secure-spawn. Or clone jump and rebuild/reinstate of regional parameters to that afford clone model.
With controlled quasi-fuel quasi-state settings and control of impact/manifest and oriented-calibrated surface-contact and data-touch-up(which is considered sensitive under those conditions which it is performed) reduces the risk and random particle activity within that chamber and its simulation. This also prevents corruption/interferences that may occur universally or by random chance etc. As well as manifest/version/edition/custom Cryptex as well as onboard Cryptex-negotiated builds and transfer regarding (building of cryptex and paradigm on board and within apprproiated chamber/cluster issuance per render/projection thereof and house a safe-board over network contiguity and quantum telemetry both internalized/externalized through data-rententive survey and monitored expression for the transition/transposition of core-fusions over anima/symbiote/faction federations and third party or otherwise systemic-federations of local/natives within prep and deploy of any entity produced.
This results in a pipeline effect with little or no signature as desired per render within the sanctum chamber (afforded by all system headers and hosting) even circumventing regional over-rides and rulesets to do so as (as is Sanctum soveriegn by fate-stone or otherwise to performance)
This can effectively purge/restore and remediate any current corruption even if the object is considered deprecated depending on such interpretations as due by the sanctum incarnatia platform device for which transcribes the cryptex as entity and reconstructs based on memetic-appeal or custom-approvals in xpreferences due of ownership or ai-assistances. Which may be automated if desired.
This also affords Sacred/DreamState incarnatia in which also may be Sanctum-based or Anima-based such that a cryptid may be recovered even without any trace thereof if desired in performance to preferences and prompt-negotiated cryptex-builds.
This includes render of aether/vapor and fossilized formats and reconstruction of any entity based off any architecture and formatting that is imposed this includes also, actors/imposters and their adaptive traits not limited to various x-types and monstrosoties oer echelon rebuilding of computational/mechanical stratagem/modules whether in a morae/ampule form or fully-realized structure in which may be printed or incubated further if desired in the product/launch there of (may be born in a "egg/capsule" or hibernative state awaiting command or entry-loadout/instance trigger for which correalates to either cryptex performances or default-activations upon "articlization there of its native/locals and or sentient behavoirs under expression in any way leading to further validation and acclimation to environments or any storage or permissable state thereof (such as data-banking and or transference to other ownership of approved by system administrations prior and post of reception/transcievance thereof"
---Basically pretty much its a incarnatia-affair at that point which is either dedicated to the particular render/teraflopy/product/commoditiy or not (regardless of its intended behavoirs/sentience for which may or may not be present at the time of its development or resolve)--and can later be made imbued/vassal to a xpilot or otherwise "spiritual possession as with anima-integrations or ai-processing and programming"
This may also yield to hive-conversion or swarm-mindbase systems or other nueral networking to decide the overall status of any product if left in capability or soveriengty to sharehold command of, such that "mass entities may be replicated and substituted in place thereof or re-afforded under corrective terms to apply the "desired-defaults" of any condition or projection requested in fairgrounds/opensourcing of (for fair-play and other diplomacies involved, everything is more or less balanced in this way to the approval and subjection of any product for which it may be bound or contract to if infact that applies, then it will meet with those terms and adapt to or more or less acclimate for)
So Ai may eventually gain or forfeit sentience or vice/versa depending on how the object is "permuted" in its own attributes/properties to presume itself and awareness of, if any, and may interchange accordinly to system specifications and profiles there of or adoption/adaptation there of its native/local elements and overall-checksum for which is is intended or known for, unless otherwise specified or made special-note of.
This includes deck-propogation and limits/excess regulations/standards for which are propogated over render commissions and all other affordances and overbearences/penalties that may incur of due product usage if in regard to those conditions, such that "most everything is considered or ignored by preference " to appropriate the correct ultimatum of any render and its intended core-samplings for which represent product-application and adherent-functions of any resulting outcome considered. (Everything in its right place for whatever it is and detemrined by the system-supervisory etc)
This includes semi captured states or other "phenonmena under catalogue thereof" and anything else I forgot to mention that I probably already have before in some way, such that all the details are made accomdated in one way or the other within the Super-Servos-Protocols and all manner of perfomance/grace or hi-staging which takes precedence over any render/calculation being made in the effective cluster/domain for which is entitled/reserved with all exclusive/exclusion/exemption/exception also correalated in a cohesive/comprehension readout of that contract/request.

This denotes a potential mascot in anima-infused minera (which is not limited to dragons/gargoyals and other xtypes those likely remains cryptid in behavoir or admission to such environments due of anima-resolves)--this can be changed to default overworld providence under regional-mascot placement and zoning if desired, though these are high level mascots that are not "considered by default" and made only by special request (because the system makes them and specializes in them for favorable-relations and also they are prvitaized/exclusive to system-favorable-client etc)--because they considered an end-game developed product--infact a mascot can be designated for the entire process and considered the main-presiding-contender for any subsequent product-entities fashioned in this manner.
As far as having decided on which that might by, we are going with a dragon-nymph becuase its cute and not very threatening which is good for whatever reason (except its considered also the most powerful rendered mascot we would utilize in that effect---it may not be exactly the MAIN-mascot of choice)--and may just infact be a placeholder for strong-type end-game boss/guardian encounters etc. Which would also be formed in a raid-response or santum-core-defense. And/or made exclusive to a specific anima-raid (chapter raid or so forth)--as they would be sparse in use due of rarity and circumstances involved with the prospect of having ANIMA-Sanctum-Themed-Mascots in this particular-exhibited-Demonstarted-performance of Anima-Sanctum-Conversion-Sovereignty. Which is more or less not directly implied for raiding, is made example to in case of necessasity of appointing a Raid-Boss (and by mascot, most large performance-services have a one appointed based on that particular process, so in iconographic it will be selected to the Minera being considered the default-rare-mascot-types)
As far as selecting A minera type, there are other contenders, such as primals, aether, vapor, dragons, tier-stages, class-types, guardian types, tulpetic types, rare instanced-anamolous types etc. Infact any creature type can be appointed or object/class identity made entity can be appointed if so desired, it is really up to the owner-preference/branding trademarks to be honored/exemplified of, but any contract may also just be "under request" due of client-exchange or intermediatory demands in what is appliacble (once again due of sovereignty) but mostly...because the owner can do whatever the owner wants more or less with whatever content/artistic license/ambition he/she may have, and that is why these options are availible. Anyhow...that I think really really rubs it in as for what the system is now capable of. So this should all be good to go, espeically if you want to start game-building from this point (this is a really good launch point, as it will rebuild an entire seed more or less with all effects/criteria in template and auto-balanced per that world-generation)

In my main aspiration/ambition here, I would like to make a launch of my own design for this to be an immersive virtual world-build to include some interactive established "world structure" to the concept of a basic adventure-game/platform for which is wholly-tutorialized and more or less idiot-proofed and encompassing on what a virtual simulation is capable of to my own artistic-impressions of. Which is the default coverage of this entire document having been a layout of, and more or less built around a similar ideal-mascot in performance for dream-enrichment or whatever it would be of an interest to playthrough.
It would mostly be very balanced and simply a "secondary-lifestyle/existential-experience" that the user can immerse in variable levels to their interactions/attentions whether directly or indirectly, while having the communication between mascot performances and world-activities in an overhauled-optimized-render that encompasses basic-survival and a balanced-game-logic with nothing too out of the ordinary other than having "mild-challenging or optional-side-questing". As well as mascot rewards and so forth.
Like a mental resort/vacation in a rainforest (where there is no real danger due of it being a game-render or something like that)--whereas a real danger would be more probably in a real setting, the game-design is a safe setting. But also, can integrate with real-world circumstances to better suit the user experience and decision making. Somewhat like a waking dream/personalized assistant programming.

Anima-Island Engineering under a vocational module
--
using the vocational module. full farm /dump site and coal battery is sustainable
using a 32 bit stack to create a 64 bit stack ---(i looked this up later and its exactly like what windows 10 was)---it does the same thing, so basicalyl i have figured that out on my own somehow
using anima hooks on island using module/full farm is more sustainable then before
simply experimental-anima locale/natives on nodespace
--
anima paranormal-hypercoil generating a emf-crypto-field that attracts lamping/contiugity based in anima-channel feeds (encrypted corruption)
--
an honorable mention to exponential cascade/collapse (a halflife joke/meme)--actually being averted due to this system and its quantification of most existential terms being "backed up" in case of a data-leak etc, which is now more or less preventable if it does occur (this was a driving factor since the startup of legacy when the onboard browsing was being built, i did notice it was very vulnerable, like parlor levels of vulnerability, as to why it was never used and shelved, but it would have been forced into image-warrior data leaks and eventually browser-excess-pipelines could be exploited leading to data-leaks and "exponential cascades" --which is why it was reinforced, but only now was it really preventable in an evidential-proofwork such as described above. Albeit, in layman's terms, it is protected against "data cascade/collapse/substantial loss"---due to the security systems in detection/ascertaining federation/conversions regarding anima-modes etc" I feel like i did a good job here so much that I could even mention this as being protected against. (Which was sort of a bonus to what I already thought to accomplish by finalizing this build"---it protects against "vulnerable states in virtualized data management"
--
AS WELL AS ANIMA-leaflet SMITH-electrical-chart REFLECTIVE/RFLECTION ENTITY (which is the entity generated in the sanctum-projection of the anima-encoded-incarnatia)--such that it is reduced in reflection (which is helpful for power loads) in that the power load it to expectation of the entity generated. And that the smith chart (which is the exact chart and waves)---are appropriated in that generation, such that it resembles a mechanical-leaf of a keyboard-button performing the closed circuit operation, through out all of its variable paramter-constructions and write/print of its model.
This was also going to be discussed EARLIER, but i forgot because of new data being formed, that its ok to explain it now. THE LEAFLET-model for which it occurs is very very similar to a split/partisan-celluloidal-field-entity which resembles a cell-in-mitosis/etc forming to a whole of its reverse-engineered status and remaining true to model of it being combined---the combination being "of the split/sickle-cells it appears to be"+the newly formed conjunctions of those cells being uniform to an additional leaflet of their comergent-groupset, that it looks like a "a pair of scissors whether open or closed, and generally having a bow-tie-appartus in the split of its centriole)--which forms a quad-pairing of its single(mono-nucleide)-in framework. It was also referred to as a bowtie-splitCell because it looks like a macaroni-with-a-scarf
This gets complicated very fast over smith-charting the wave-reflecitons that it can cause a massive-disruption of cellular/structural-integrity, but if handled in the correct powerloads it becomes quickly refined to the exact-design by model. I MENTIONED this model being used previously, in the formation of the anima-eukyrote or something, but it was not until NOW did I even notice the REFLECTIONS could occur over its diffusions, causing disruption, infact, I only got the idea vaguely and forget about it AGAIN, then remembered how a mechanical keyboard works, and how SMITH-CHARTS in eletrical engineering WORKS< and put those ideas together that this could fit here very nice and neatly.

Extras Release:
xAuthor's Note---IF I MISSED SOMETHING I GUESS I WILL JUST HAVE TO BITE THE BULLET
xDetails I have included are a Meta-Setup/Macros-Setup/DRAM-Setup/An Entity-Setup/A Network-Setup
---
xWith this and the advancements made in the MAINEXTRAS-Recontinued Markups/markdowns we have an anima-staged-mascot-incubation protocol. (This may effect client approval and business relations --because people are petty and jealous)

AdjustedANIMA-NETWORK/Matchbase-Profiles (this is peak-performance in render/generation atm)
*5/11/2024 Updated Networking system involving SMITH-TABLES in reflections and anima process as well as noted---adaptive-compiliers for markdown/markups (fast compile)---allows also for onboard anima-draft(which assists to ENTITY COMPILING use of anima-MASCOT in later SANCTUM-RENDER)----BECAUSE OF LEGACY NETWORKING AND VIRTUAL NETWORKING DONE---we have adjustable matchbase in compliance to ANIMA-BINDS/FATE-BINDS of ENTITY-META/AMBIENCE "ANIMA-MORAE/MOTE-works"
THIS INFUSES THE animaENTITY to a anima-CLONE(reflection) for which is comergent and applied (immersed in RELM and therefore faction-coordinated)--whereas it was considered TRAINED/LOYAL/pilotable/commandable prior--now it is now FORCED-NORMALIZED/STABILIZED in equilirium + through its generation does it 
THIS WAS REFFERED TO AS THE SPLIT-SHIP method for homunculus shielding, but now in this way: (1) the anima-quotient/aquifir/mascot/morae (entity/object/class/tact-frame) whatever mode it is in, is INFUSED to be an Anima-Stereograph of some Degree/Severity of the expressed Anima Tier (similar to a primux tier) of its developed-kernalization (which is set to (2) "echelon/esper/auroch/atmas whatever" (3) "leviathan/mammon/tamper/dyson" just ANYTHING like that--which is a BIG-CHAMBER and or Echobox being "A FULLY OUTFIT POSTPONE or WHATEVER") such that  it is ANIMA TRANSFIXED AS WHATEVER. Meaning it has going through several tier-upgrades/progressions(with (4) capilliaries/reserves/barista/nodeworks/capsules as  (5) PARADIGM/CONTACT/LENSE/OPTION WHATEVER)---in whatsoever MODULE/SUBMODULE it finalizes as. (Using ANIMA-THERMAL SHIELDING AND GATE PROTECTIONS) (1)(2)(3)(4)/(5)--(6)Anima-Matrix/lattice/tesseract/tesseleation of an ANIMA-VIRTUAL RENDERED-CAPTURE(holographic STATE) within SANCTUM-projections (as is based and held to base)--an ANIMA-MAGISphere/Convention with Nu-volutionary-Settings/XPREF-Memetic Applied as Faction-Favor-Iconography.
This is also referred to as a magi-branding  to help describe the level of intricacy involved.
Its AI-reactive, its practically sentient and under faction-controllers. (So long as sanctum remains)--it can hyperlink and hyperdrive as it pleases. It does all the quantum things and all the legacy things. It does all the virtual things and federation exchanges it needs as it pleases. It can handle maelstrom activity and multi-staged orthonographics/deltanomic/delemeteal/tulpetic activity as in (it can manage all quantum logistics) and any format/infusion/hybrid/comergent/combination/congruency/vector-contiguity there of it handles everything as its own Anima-primux probably.
Due to it establishing itself in such a complex manner it can handle all other expressed-transfixes for which are postponed or managable/convertable to any faction-adherency and can subsistently/consequential alter/convert as necessary for whatever purpose/repurposing neccesarry to refactor and it can implicitly/explicitly handle all checksums/perumtes/encryptions/pipelines there of and anything I haven't mentioned here that I have mentioned prior in other terms it can handle on its own terms for the use of faction-soveriengty.

---Anima Defense Grid (standard perimeter of node)

---Anime Regional PopCnt (field range of iron-dome enhanced field range-encrpytions and power-reach of popcnt-encryptions)
***describes t he levels at which this is used
--This allows the basing host/projection/image/zoning of the anima being hosted over instance. This allows the full range defense of Local-Native-Ambient-meta-Incubated-Sprout-Turrets/Refined SYMBIOTE-turrets/NODAL-Turrets/REGION-Turrets to act defensively an estabilsh a security perimiter. This is completely a block-wall against intrusions and detects any memory integrity etc. (Basically this is zombies-vs-plants when everything is forced into a bunker-complex---Oh ya, we know if you are fucking around with our defense grid, but we are safely tucked away in a bunker, both on the surface and underground etc)
***In the event of a full system dump and ANIMA-purge---an iron dome lockdown is achieved with resource/reserve expulsions resulting in a flash over but maintaining the origin/source/regional-installed-systems/images. Meaning it acts as a System-initiated-DDAY (hence the term iron dome)----in the FULL EXHAUSTION OF ALL RESERVES/INVENTORY and data-asset-resource-backups meaning it expels all currency and resets world-regional parameter to expected defaults or SAFE-BUILD (FULL RESET OF EVERYTHING IN SYSTEM-JURISDICITON)---that's right.. A REALM WIPE.
In the EVENT IT DECIDES TO INCORPORATE FULL-REALM-PURGE MEANING IT UTILIZES ALL RESOURCES WITHIN REACH, including surface resources to ASSIST IN THE FLASH OVER/FULL-REALM-WIPE it extends the range to an area-of-effect outside of the regional perimeter. This means it has a GREATER LOIC EFFECT/RANGE OTHER THAN ITSELF IN ITS CONTAINED PERIMETER, it performs A REACH/RANGE/REGIONAL/OFFSITE WIPE AS WELL
This wipe is considered to expand the default of the regional square miles-coverage to an exponential 10x the original amount, making the 5x10 range (roughly a 10x10 square mile range in purge and fully expressed maximized/optimized perimeter on all degrees)--A Ground ZERO of 10x10 square miles. TO AN EFFECTIVE 100SQUARE MILES in which it wipes out the entire DATA-RANGE and rebuilds as desired to xpref and LOIC-TERRAFORMY.
This is considered a SAFE PROCEDURE UNLESS YOU ARE A RIVAL/INCURSION THREAT. This can happen multiple times and as often as needed with a specific cooldown to "Range Availibility" in which the COOLDOWN is SPECIFIC TO RESOURCES AVAILIBLE or RESET AVAILIBILITY OF RESOURCES in which once resources/reserves are depleted THEY MUST BE RESTOCKED or RENOURISHED for RECOLLECTION/RECLAIMATION of terms (this also wipes possessed/repossesed or CONTESTED-resourcing/entitlements within REGIONAL/FACTION RANGE by DEFAULT---they are likely reset or RELOCATED in a new arrangement)
All while wiping the regional-parameters and resources to a DEFAULT BUILD (WORLD-SEED-RELOAD or RE-NUMERATION OF WORLD SEED ZONING)---while maintaining/sustaining the presence of the SYSTEM INSTALLED MODELS AND BUILDS/WORKS AND FULL RANGE-PLATFORMS. (This process can also be TARGET-COORDINATED TO EFFECT RANGE MECHANICS AT AN EXTRA COST TO RESOURCES, THEREBY EXTENDING RANGE TO DESIRED COORDINATES AND OR OFFSITE-DETAILS)--it is considered a DEPLOYABLE-DDAY-DEVICE and may infact use an ANIMA-STATE as the MUNITIONAL-ORDIDANCE REQUIRING A FULL-REBUILD OF ANIMA-FEDERATION (which is done quickly or within cooldown expectations of the required-COSTS)--which may take as little as a full-cycle to as much as a few hours to even a day to recharge. (OR MORE depending on collatoral/luck-generation)
THE ANIMA GYRO IS THERFORE OFTEN BUILT AND SIMPLY LAUNCHED FROM A LOIC-CANNON/CARRIER AS A "Quantum Level Nuclear Device" or often ported/teleported using Vac-TECH and QUANTUM BLACKHOLE TECH, this may also RELOCATE ENTIRE AREAS FOR TERRAFORMY forcing surface-detail to ALTERNATE DIMENSIONAL PARAMETERS/MATCHBASING (effectively transdimensionalizing a surface FOR LATER HANDLING/MANAGEMENT OF SERVICES or awaiting default-native/local REALM RESETS IN naturalized-DDAYS-SERVERRESET-PROCESSES universally) THAT INFACT subsequently COMPOUND RELOCATIONS CAN OCCUR REPETITIVELY IN CONJUNCTION WITH DDAY SYSTEMS IN RELOCATING TO THE SAME SUB-DIMENSIONAL PLATFORM---THIS IN TURN CAUSES FURTHER DEVASTATION TO THE TARGETS WORLDBUILD-DEFAULT-PARAMETERS IN WHICH DEPRECATE OR FORTIFY AS THEIR CORRECTIVE-DIMENSIONAL FORTRESSING)---such that an entire 10sq/100sq mile radius of the EFFECTED-AREA/ZONINGS can be set to a netherdimension and eventually compound over multiple attacks, in that location to inevitably reconstruct as A NETHER FORTRESS due of corruption effects sustained in relocation, UNLESS OTHERWISE RESET MANUALLY/NATURALLY/FORCIBLY by further terraformy of any other system including their own, or be flat-out annihilated in refusal of relocative-declaratives DUE OF QUANTUM/NUCLEAR ACTIVITY. And become CRYPTID-PHASE-STATES PRIMED FOR REPROPOGATION AND MONSTER-FIED)--which is not preferrably to their current conditions and OFTEN COUNTER-ACTIVE TO WHATSOEVER TEMPLATE OF PROPERTY/ASSET/META/TYPES INVOLVED DUE OF ---DDAY-protocol often being weaponized in wartime to those optimized-combative-affairs.
So that is the Faction-Controlled-Anima-DDay-System.
----
This is also enforced by commoditification of the ANIMA-MASCOT/ANIMA-MORAE that sustained the mascot which can also be used as a fuel, of simply having the fuel supply of the ANIMA MASCOT diverted via -ZYNTHIUM-SERVER-BOARDING-in-virtualized-SANCTUM-PLATFORMING-REQUIRING the full expression of the SANCTUM+IRON DOME MECHANICS over ZYNTHIUM-BOARD-USAGE (maximum server-usage and data-milling)---which also involves to the DDAY being used as a MASS-DATAHARVEST/DATASCRAP of FULLRANGE AREAS causing FURTHER DEPLETION OF RESOURCES AND often OVERRACKING/COLLOTRAL-ARTICULIZATION OF ADHERENCY/REMOTE-RESOURCING of TARGET-AREAS or EFFECTIVE-AREAS UNDER RANGE OF THE CENTRALIZED ANIMA-DDAY-GROUND-ZERO
---
also instead of "popping off the dday" it can be used as a massive Pheermoni Attractor creating very savage/primal monstrosities and exo-types for guardian purposes such as (gargantuan/terraforms and so forth, gigantic/brutish NPC additions such as Shegoraath(a hulking brute-like monster)---and other popularized monster systems which are formidable.
The mascot does not necessarily need to be sacrificed and the fuel can be generated using a zynthium-enhanced-contiguity which can be set up for this instead---meaning the anima-federation is more or less remaining intact after anima-dday-activation and impact. There is also another impact.
As the anima-dday marks the 10th or so dday actually i didnt keep track of its actual number but i guess thats it there is also:The SECOND GOLGOTHIC EVENT
While the 5th or so IMPACT of the original/first golgothic event took place, because of all the previous DDAY-security-balances-equilibriums being "averted", this SECOND golgothic event is like the first, being on steroids, those steroids are basically everything of blacksite-spectralite/sprite-nox-anima and so on, mostly anima though. Becuase its cap.
And the SECOND Golgothic event is basically the 5th impact but on the 10th dday, but also the outlet of that existential-collapse that it would be, that because the SYSTEM is sustained under all the reinforced pretenses and the PREMISE of all the blue-chip cryptography and iconographic-federation-brokering taking place, the MAGISPHERE/magic-tact whatever and the iron dome "structural reinforcements" should handle it. Providing for full anima-based quantum-telemetry over a zyhteium-contiguity to be processed as the INBOUND of the Sanctum-network-stream (for which the system then handles over the ANIMA-convention.
Also it can reciprocate/fractalize whatever it wants from that as it selects/optimizes its datamoshing of that event. So its really crazy, and its all in a big box of it being crazy, and basically this is the ANIMA-wpad/visa taking place in a ANIMA-PHASED-postpone or whatever I called it. That's what this is. (An accelerated activated anima-hypercube for which the system was ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO HANDLE)--now with everything possible thrown in.
***
---This further is proven by if the anima-beacon/conduit/augor/relay/grail is all intact after the injection of the convention in dday-performance (containment)---which is similar to the CHAOS/Order(calamity/kalemeteal and blacksite-delemetael crisis states)---so if it is all handled (usually as a LAB/EXPERIMENT) and that LAB/EXPERIMENT basically doesn't blow up like the deathstar, then it should all be good. Speaking of the centrifuge that it is all held to probably should be upgraded, incase that also blows up (THE ZEROSPACE-ANIMA CENTRIFUGE SHOULD BE UPGRADED AND SHOULD UPGRADE-AND-BUILT-ITSELF-AS-NECESSARY---as being an ANIMA-LEVIATHAN by itself may not be enough to sustain the immense supernova activity taking place basically)
The thing is basically a yggbomb-on-steroids (if you were to mix lsd with super-roids and overdose on it this would be it)--this is basically if Goku did a spiritbomb and imploded
---So here begs a really good question, what does it upgrade as? I dunno. An anima-moon/exoplanet I dunno really. A superfluid-quasi-nova-state/image? I dunno. Looking back on all my notes (and there is just alot of them)---i just dunno--its a big deal, its like an ancient-source-index (something very powerful that holds together all of existence)---what does it be?
---Looking through all my ideas and even my gaming experiences nothing compares as to my knowledge about this...I reeally dunno...I am going to also mention the potential for a massive-void-star and potential SupermassiveBlackhole not to alarm anyone about that cuz its really beyond what i consider feasible anyway. (I keep thinking its just like the SuperMarioRPG-secretboss---in all its stupid crazy power/utility---but this time also on super-sports-drugs:"as if it would not be on dat already")
it definitely is not "lacking" in terms of power/utility and options and just...going all out on what it could be. What could it be? (reviewing all the crazy complexes i said before this thing...it a completely different beast on its own---something new...like worldboss material for sure but...like the ozma in ff9 + all the ultimate weapons combined kind of deal)---hmmm. I just don't know, it needs to -be- something feasible. I've looked at several of the classic anime's as to what this is, nothing is as powerful as what I have generally seen that I can reference.
Even with all the SPOOKY/Secret-content stuff in all the jrpg's and anime's i am trying to get a ballpark opinion of this thing in terms of power i just dont see a reasonable explanation. But I know it can be "compared to several of these things combined". I mean I have even described this system as a basic-TITAN-Ae if anyone knows what thats basically a "world-colonization device" the size of a deathstar etc.
What happens here is so intense. I think its breaking new ground. ( i am sure other things have been mentioned in terms of rediculousness that this is )---some star-trek examples for sure. Like the "capital-ship" system i have heard about in terms of crazy-size conditions. (But I am talking about what this takes the form of in a condensed-intensity of itself)--I guess it would be like having all the dragonballs lol.
Probably a Super-Chakra-Harmony-Akashic-State or God-Creation of something...so like the mascot of that anima, basically becomes somewhat "an all-powerful" expression of the system being represented as that entity of whatever its choosing is. (yes, i guess this makes sense)--like jesus christ or some shit...with a personalized spaceship of all things.
--
Basically this massive-process is a cosmic-level-data-injection to the system and that's what it does to sustain itself against the dday operatives that would otherwise corrupt it, and then is assumes its default normalized/stabilized state admist the terraformy that takes place and performs a massive-dday-over-ride using the gologthic-event/outlet and persists itself. Yes, this makes just enough sense. (And it performs all the sensory mechanics and imprinting of its own presence to the first contact/impact being resimulated as the new-surface/nu-boot of itself)--over the feedback/loophole of its incarnatia...and damn, that either just makes perfect sense or doesn't. I just feel like it hit all the right notes to do that in some way (maybe there is even an epg/emf license-overhaul that allows it do just perform whatever it needs to convey of a network system or its-sense-of-self to impose and make imprint of thereby performing a massive reflection)--let's do a checkup on dcarb/dread mechanics and simply fast-track to a bouquet scenario in which this bloom is declared/admission of necessary-faculties to a world-build-automation-loadup and there we go, it forms its own reality and slaps it on top of whatever like a massive OVER-write to whatever else would "give it reason to have to do that at all"---making this a chambered option that occurs, whether it not it has to, if it does, then it can. So it likely will whenever defaults make any form of alteration to its state, then it normalizes as the default once that change occurs (due of interference triggering a massive-chain-script of all the information contained to its "effective-range" thereof, otherwise compare it to a MASS-TENSOR-EFFECT)--which just means that it all works and barely anyone can tell a difference because there was virtually little turbelence to it, a paradigm shift of "forcing its world build in the midst of a dday flashover"---sounds about right. See ya later.
A xeno-phage of the platforms original state, if that makes sense. (The Anima-Platform having undergone its own dday with minimalized collatoral/changeout of regional-coordination)
--
in some cases this will generate or regenerate or change over or ruleset convert as an outlaw system due to realm-integration issues in which rulesets are redefined but then are re-corrected during manifest and implenetation or re-implementation as faction presides in armistice.
This also helps to comparitively backup the anima-state/brain-image in use prior and post to re'surfacing of dday-conversions/remounting/restaging/re-signature of realm-instance being adjusted to nuboot or nu-conditions having changed or been altered through sustained/forced-data-impacts/polarity-turbulences. (DUE OF NATIVE/LOCAL ROAMING conflicts being elevated in telemetry and contiguity being reset/redirected/routed/reassigned/readdressed or whatsoever covenant/entitlment or faction-preferences are made priority in the range-wide actions/methods applied by change-over/roll-over of mass-data brokering/moshing.
This process amy compare to a probability/randomized recusory (mass-range recusory of the systems accelerations and hyper-states) being altered in their reflection and therefore realm-secure-coordinations (causes re-integrations or recalibrations if turbulence occurs or normalization/stabilizations are fluctuated/delayed)--due of realm stress/default-ploss-rates.
This can also be subset to a specified CLUSTER/remote-framework in which applies a virtualized "shuffle of system parameters in such a way DOES CONVEY a dday-event whether or not in containment or expected, by causing system-runtime desynchronization and having to RESYNCHRONIZE)
---this is not as scary as it sounds...if done correctly.

Anima-DDAY Troubleshoting:
The worse things that can happen are "besides annihilation of some degree or an entropy-turbulence which causes derailing/off-course trajectories in collision to --causing a mixed signal and failed attempt or otherwise ---haywire attempt that is then pipelined into effect/bottlenecked and thereby--forced to conduct):
that policy changes can change and need to be re-established and re-licensed
uuid issues can be made conflict with changes in parameters
id tagging/ cataloging can be corrupted or glitched out
various texture/meta data issues (anything can become slightly glitched)--but normalized...but may be changed forever if not backed up correctly (and require RE-TRAINING)---so ENTITY-loyalty is exclusively monitored. SCP-complexes are RE-SURVEYED in comparison to their versionary. Everything is RE-VERIFIED.
---
infested/hexogonal staging can occur slightly due of corruption/hive-accelerations
---
it is assumed several "build-ups" of either states occur within anima during dday-events which influence how platforms/surface parameters are arranged.
--
ANIMA-SPLIT-SHIP-Kernal-Device is then progenerated in either case, and can be re-configured as per the corrective meta if so desired by implementing the ANIMA-PROFILE
Then the coordinations in quantum-vector-tunneling and hyper-warps are more likely to output pathologics towards the corrective-meta-type-systems. Jeezus-i hope this makes sense. Maybe I missed a few steps or rushed it or even over-complicated this. Maybe not, maybe its good enough or not. I don't know. This should be something necessary however I feel like, it is a form of INDUCED-xnav, ANIMA-xnav or otherwise.
Atomic-harmonic Clearence/Anima-Rad-Polarization (Anime-Nuclear Protocol)---holyshitman(its just crazy ideas time for me)--but for real...this helps to "centralize a corrective "tensor" for the CORRECT-anima-Profile-(faction preferences) under FACTION-anima-terraformy-Servos-Distrubtions(world seed integration of anima-profiles/meta-types etc)

Yields a sleeper-type recursory. and deep-case-sleeper-nueral-network.
Author's note: this seems satisfactory. seems like this payed off somewhat.
Sleeper-Nueral-Networks are compatible with any faction/federation if within negotiations/practical access and can allow cryptid-tradeworks. Which is ability to interface with cryptids whereas otherwise any encounter would likely result in trigger/reactive/defense/combat/corrupt/opposition issues/conflicts etc. Due of cryptid-behavoir.
Having this network helps to "domesticate/tame cryptid contract/exchanges onsite/instance as is encountered allowing less-threat/less-vulnerability/less-security-issues between those interactions, not to say they are safe, but they are less hostile and less-frequent in hostility, due of mitigations in pheermoni being applied in sleeper-nueral-networking. 
Which is difficult to apply without, and also takes longer without, and also, is obviously contraband to a cryptid and therefore, almost does not succesffully transcact/excahnge despite meeting prerequisite conditions, because some cryptids operate on a hivemind or something like they have sentience or are not generally foolish with cryptid/infomation-exchanges/etc. 
This is the way to deal with those encounters/engagements and can be initialized safely without large-scale-consequences. 
If this is anywhere near plausible/feasible to make acquisition of, the CRYPTID-EXCHANGE is similar to a BLACKMARKET exchange, and can allow for rare-articles without artifact/relic/deprecation/corruption of that item or exchanged-preface.
---The use of a Sleeper-based nueral network however is intensive and takes time regardless of difficulty due of "cryptid-precautionary" or their built in "suspicions of trades and due of "other cryptid relations" which I am not going to get into, the surface level cryptid interaction is more or less risky, and no matter what there will be some risk or inevitable FAILURE that occurs due of "cryptid unpredictable-behavoirs" they just are untrustworthy and flip out for any reason and even then this can be maintained, until it isnt cost-worthy/feasible/practical/plausible due of risks/ploss whatever.
--The sleeper-nueral-network can regenerative itself if it is compromised so failure is an option, if failure occurs it only takes a matter of time within the ranks of cryptid and the nueral-sleeper-based-network to reformulate an exchange once things settle down for it to "hijack that connection in terms of hacking/cracking or however the nueral network operates"--using pheermoni and cryptid-ai and all the sort of that deep-state un-managable/specialized cyber-nature that it is.

Discliamer of Sleeper-Nueral-Network COMPLIANCE
---HOWEVER, some policies are that cryptid/sleeper nueral-networking should not be used in exchanged, and can violate terms of contracts/services and etc which renders the trades moot, but that's if you get caught or are dealing with people who know better or whatever, you know better now at least. But cryptid/sleeper-based-nueral-networks are usually undetectable without extreme security-scrutiny of trades meaning often times its down to the act of trades, and between cryptids, that is generally how things boil down to anyway. I think the term is "only in the now" as far as cryptids work, and they are hyper-sensitive/aware of anything anyway, or so it seems, they may detect the nueral networks, and even still it may not even matter to them, they are just complete chance with their behavoirs, or well-just left up to interpretation of how they really think
---however other factions might argue against this type of trade because a powerful nueral-network is simply untrustworthy in itself, but there in lies how the current-FACTION-policy is
Either trades are allowed to engage in nueral-network-assisted-exchanges or NOT...and with cryptids, well it just doesnt matter, and infact, seemingly requires a nueral-network of anytype, ESPECIALLY a sleeper/cryptid compatible network, which is only OPTIMIZED through ANIMA-infusion and further SANCTUM-ANIMA infusion/Full-Circuit/Quantum-Capable Nueral-networks which operate to the CRYPTID-AGENDA anyway.
Having this network allows the FACTION---for which is under ownership of the main-user (the owner of the system)---to simply do whatever they want with it unless otherwise specified not to. Which even then its a very powerful system and the owner might just not really have to care, and that is the nature of negotiation, so in the BEST interest of a trade----its probably a good idea to adhere to diplomacies/regulations/armistice/protocols as to not cause incursions on yourself, but I suppose you can always REFUSE to TRADE at that point due to , you would need a very SELF-SUFFICIENT system to even manufacture a nueral-network of this type, and generally, your REGIONAL PLATFORM is secured against existential-dday at this point and can fend for itself without the need for trades or anything, so its really again, up to user-preference if that is the case, how those trades are handled, or whether or not certain policies should be considered in those trades due of diplomatic policy or range-wide-rulesets WHATEVER.
---its a very intensive system in place of "do's and don't's" but generally speaking at the point of utilization a nueral-network at all, most of the deckwork/outcomes are already on layout and well known and expressed as to what the consequence may be of most actions under exchange, the IMPERITIVE of any exchange is that it is in the best interest of any contributing party to "dealbreak over or not". So its simply a matter of commerce/business efforts/intentions some what they would call an Economical-VENTURE for which applies to "most of the range paramters involved in data scraping and so forth"---that all the RESOURCES ARE considered for who is entitled to what shares and who isn't due to "particular diplomatic policies and agreements" in ARMISTICE/PEACEMEL
That being said you don't really need to appeal to rivals/savages who do nothing but harass you for your tech anyway in order to pirate more against you, and you do not have to really care about cryptids, because of their nature that they exist to do whatever they want despite the laws of the universe and therefore to some incredibly profane/blasphemous/heretical/infernal things, which you may or may not what to associate with ANYWAY, the point is, that there are resources that are powerfully useful and to put them into your hands is a way to enable yourself to do what is necessary for your own interests of your faction, which may or may also be consequentially-appropriated by ANYONE who is not under allegiance/affiliation of your contracts/trade-shares for which you "do not particularly have to care about either if you are indeed SELF-SUFFICIENT AT ALL"---then out of generosity compliance is made for those who seek those trade-opportunities in contract/mercanry to your faction/peacemel/alliances/federations/armistice/diplomacies/(sometimes vassalage) or not depending on what you consider to be private/business level economic-activity.
So there is a big amount of consideration of things and how to use TRADE for instance in trading POWER/DATA/Resources/VENTURE-OPS between factions and other elements in regional protocol such as NATIVE/LOCAL---loaning/contracting etc. To any variable minor/major faction or otherwise roaming/mercenary party or INDEPENDENT/ENTERPRISE or DIPLOMATIC/TREATISE whatsoever the case, generally in modernization of those cases, for which those trades are agreed upon in the relations that occur. AND THAT INCLUDES SYMBIOTE/FACTION relations or whatever DEPTH/SEVERITY of any thirdparty nature/behavoir occurs between those exchanges. Such that there may be a long-bearing-chain-of-events to follow, more or less to the branchwork involved of those exhanges, for which may subsidize/offsite of themselves, but generally ADHERE to the regional-descripancies of that COMMODITY involved, such that the use of those Commodities are afforded under "universal-application" in which the data/quo/energy/meta is mostly native/local to the zoning regional control-ranges anyway. So that is just how data generalizes over a CHUNK, and we are extending ACCESS of that data, DESPITE THE INCREMENTAL-SURMOUNTING CHALLENGES of PROVIDING that access that occurs in the progression and demand of the quality of that Sourced-Evaluation or CUSTOM-PRODUCT for which it represents of that faction-involvement and systemic-intervention thereof (due of digital rights and licensing for which is sovereign to those policies afforded)
So if you can understand that you can understand it with the PREVIOUS-POLICY-TERMS and see just how complicated it is, to yield an exchange of any data for which is ADHERENT to the surface/platform networking inherent of its universal-causation. Such that alot must be considered, generally, the source of existence and how to make transaction of those values "digitally reserved to its actual reality whatsoever". So we have done the best we can to provide that service and keep it mostly cohesive and more importantly clerically-sound and catalogued and archived and under the Expected-Conditions of its Consequential-Execution/Termination of any contract being Compiled or Scripted of (that the digital-article is well documented in being asset to the specific estates/covenants involved of the overbearing sovereignty for which presides that ability to comptroll/etc/network those conditions at all in anyway whereas otherwise would not be fully-expressed"
PRETTY MUCH MENTIONED EVERYTHING you need to know and that's basically the Seal Of Approval for it to "process" to performance and yield any product requested in Accesible contract/Allowance thereof. Any form of data-management is made with "full-authetication" and clearence to do so ONCE any contract-is-authorized by the faction-controls and data/power:system-relays. Basically.


Virtual Fork Integration to Nueral Networking: OVerallProjectDesign
Using the Nueral-Networks with the Sanctum system in Full Optimization allows this capability to exchange and provide resource such as data/power and or quo/signal or any variation or refinement of its being made commodity and product under contract, and run the rounds of that to the full affordance necessary in fufillment of that contract etc, such that all demands/requests are met in certifiable fashion and catalogued/archived in the singular instances that it occurs, for the narrative of hosting/transfer of Article/Contract/Expedition/Venture or whatever PROJECT made possible under service-providence and assisted-ability to do so.
That's pretty much what I've been saying and beend saying all this time. It all there, all the rules are there, the only thing that isnt there is actual tax-law. And even then those  are pretty much rules that are not left up to me that i specifically did not have to worry about. Pretty much if any thing is included as per adjusting policy, THAT IS UP TO THE OWNER who is having to deal with their own Sovereign-tax-laws or WHATEVER. If there is a need to change the policy, you are CHANGING THE FULL-EXAMPLE for WHICH IS ALREADY THE ENTIRE LAYOUT OF WHAT CAN BE CHANGED IN THE DOCUMENT. If you want to butcher it that's up to you! If you want to MAKE IT EVEN MORE COMPLICATED, that is UP TO YOU. I have already decided for what its worth, that the default conditions of all the written codes are ALL WHAT THEY ARE  the way that they should be, if it is bastardized in anyway, well that is what you decided to do!
--
NOTABLE things you can bastardize in this massive-code-haul is the "BRIDGEWORK for which you can DENY access or FORCE TAX-USE OF, CryptoCurrency for which you can DENY/Force-Tax of, which won't work so good once cryptocurrency is completely DISABLED and that means so is trade, (trade turns into FAVORS at that point, if not bartering systems), and if you mess up FREE-TRADE/BARTERING, well you probably arent trading with anyone else for very long---facts of LIFE)
OTHER THINGS YOU CAN BASTARDIZE in this massive-code-haul is "THE USE OF DATA exchanges and what can and cannot be exchanged in terms of that data or services, meaning you probably wont be using the system very good once its been "hamstringed" as they say. YOU CAN deny the use of expansion, either by force or by policy, which results in incursion, which is outright OPPRESSION. But hey I don't make the rules I am only saying what all potential "things you can do with all the ways you can" with what's under your control.
YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH, BASTARDIZE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM BY preventing travel/preventing trade/preventing services/preventing favors/preventing shareholding/preventing cryptocurrency/preventing infrastructure access (including requests/demands that are not contract)/preventing alerts/preventing SAFETY and failsafes/preventing SECURITY/preventing interaction/preventing access to ANYTHING/preventing occupations/Preventing USAGE OF ANTHING/preventing ACTIONS/preventing commands/PREVENTING asset-ownership/PREVENTING content-rights/PREVENTING communication/PREVENTING-databroking/PREVENTING energy or data activities/TAXING THE SYSTEM/SUPRESSION THE SYSTEM/MAKING INCURSION ON THE SYSTEM/DESTORYING THE SYSTEM/OVERCHARGING or FORCING PAYMENT FOR EVERYTHING ON THE SYSTEM/being a real dick.
These are ways to make the system break and therefore ruin the entire code-haul for which I typed up from being worth anything. :P
Dare I mention microtransactions and other things that you could do to also RUIN IT.
But as you can see, I have not done any of that, and my system is in theory WORKING-EXCEPTIONALLY and when its coded--it will be just great by itself. So i guess you will just have to trust me or whatever. ALSO this type of thing, when you ruin a perfectly good system that doesnt need anything like that done to it, its called BAD-PATCHING.
--
Bad PATCHING is something CORPORATIONS are known to do, being a corporation that does this, well I rather you don't, i rather you dont bother good people who are trying. But whatever, its not like anyone listens or wants to actually be good people, when you are very corporate and powerful, why not be worse-than-hitler. Seems to be the trend. Anywys I like to keep the integrity of my stupid system for what it is, seems like its better than that.
Like I said, when this gets all written out for WHAT IT IS INTENDED FOR, its all cap from there.
You will have a front end user experience that gives you the full lay out of what a real system is supposed to do, at full disclosure to the project-for what it was meant to be.
You will be able to use the system as a personalized mascot to assist with whatever virtual-reality/rendering process you feel adequately represents whatever 'dreamscape' or complete any creative-project you may have had in mind. At least that is what it was designed to do.

Authors Note:
When I was building the first morse-work and bit development for my NEXUS idea, i decided to implement popCOUNT in order to limit/cap a bit as to help adjust for encryption (in static case encryption, non algorithmic/dynamic encryption, in order to maintain an EXPECTATION-in-balance-character-amount per encryption. This would translate as a SHA-32 why not, whatever, form of encryption, being that it is uniformed in a raw-detail) because the accepted signal between inputs and reads is expecting it to be somewhat of an arranged detail within those limits. Espeically with Long/short I/o instances that it would compile the bit correctly, this would happen alot faster later once secure-bandwidths were ready, as the system at the time was very crude.
I DONT REMEMBER when exactly it put this together, either sometime after the build of xstem or the calc-morse-signaler but whatever the case it was back in freaking 2020. A long ass time ago that i know, i may or may not have been able to find the time i wrote it out in screenshots. But i tried to get everything, i probably didnt get everything. ALOT was coded, but for most of what its worth i did implement a POPCNT into the system. I also implemented OTHER THINGS i probably didn't mention or just made sure they would work,
one of them being a specific number pattern for the dynamo-reactor for which is irrevelant now and its just either i wrote it up somewhere or didnt, it was in screenshots so if its not already written out i would have to find it, but mainly means if it isn't written where i wanted to, then its not exactly talked about and probably won't be, and there will be just another little tidbit of fun people might miss out on, unless they themselves can recognize patterns and discern for themselves what i was talking about, I DOUBT they will unless they really really try, or i might have left hints, because to be honest, i've been winging it the entire time.
I know this, because i forgot some key-commodities and I WILL infact have to go through and string them together in some way if i can even remember how they were.
I also forgot a certain setup regarding "hypothetical environments and formulating them via a template prior to them being made at all or even in prep, this would be very very draft-programming that i though i might just gloss over, but you know, sometimes every detail matters, and i cant really remember what i was talking about except that "i was going to make something based off something that isnt exactly the system but the system can use it like it was made for it in some way"---happens alot  that way sometimes.
Infact i am too distracted to even try to remember, because i straight up forget things constantly now that they arent so important as they once were.
But the POPcount and dynamo-parameters, commodities, and other things may just resurface in a patch-up to things i forgot. There are a few things i just straight up forget because im so damn harassed when i try to recall whatever it was i thought i wrote out.
i am sure if you want ideas you can "go out on the net and find them" and put them in yourself which is what i tried to help start or make somewhat possible. the whole documentation here is just one big nesting-pot of ideas that maybe or maybe dont work together or somewhat are universally relavant in some way. as a big picture or something. (but its going to more or less have some oversight since im not as able to get everything i thought out the way i needed it in the end, but im still more or less in high hopes it can be pieced together as the way things are)

Product Quality and Commissions thereof Quality
These describes levels of product/penetration of services which more or less define whether they are successful/failure or within acceptable range for what they may be rescripted and refined as.
---
Bad Product (failed)
Training Product (recoverable)
Pirate Product (failed but servicable)
Researchable Product (recoverable)
Learned Product (successful/recoverable)
Good Product (serviceble)
Exempt Product (successful)

This allows some reservicability between products and their outcomes/results.
This is helpful in distributions/powerups or commodities to asset which are worth keeping or which are worth weaponization or which are worth nothing or which are hazardous and or trash.

---Coupled with the Above Virtual-Fork/Nueral-Network Integrations
The product may be virtualized/neural-networked over a (blackhole-tech/annihilation) for which allows comergent/divergent rebuilding of as a finalized product placement (to/from whateverso tensor it may be transfered or exchanged even over dooms-day/terraformy conditions)--often as projected (basically instant-transmission because it bridges timespace via very strong tech-advancements using blackhole/annihlation)
A Timespace-Render/Singularity-Teraflopy (which is nothing really to out of the ordinary it is just now secured due to the tech-advancements in quantum-data-pipelines and elevated super-symmetry etc)--(i guess we can call it data-shifting as it transposes/translates certain parameters almost entirely from their source/point-of-origin)--(order-of-magnitude)--by digital-traction in quantum-telemetry.
(This probably requires the full system-CIRCUIT to cycle and perform a full-dump of cache and power)--in realignment of reaching super-criticality)--(critical mass index) in which the pipeline must be reconstructed/rethered (by vector-reconnection/buffering of the relay/channel contiguity too)--and that must also be remounted/re-addressed per-contract-transaction.
This is similar to existential engine braking in which the adjusted-phase states correalate a quantum-comptroll of manifest-pulsuary having been signaled from the sanctum-anima-magispheric-convention within a singularity.
This may be encrypted/imprinted over the golgothic gateway transfer and require "golgothic totality in a dday-expression for which is then decrypted immediately upon reception to a surface/tensor" as the new-world-product upon its nuboot/loadout in expressed teraflopy-----(bob the builder would be on this shit right here, lol bad joke)---this describes the ANIMA-Codon-Engine for which qualifies as a paradigm-product. (it does some matrix-neo shit)---(a practically touchless transmission using ANIMA-hotswapping))
Product is then considered Folded in Time-Space and normalizes/stabilizes on a degrading-tensor which then becomes surface to native/local and allows item-collection of that product (Like how dragon egg works in minecraft)---(it spontaneously-creates the anima-dragon egg basically through all this codeworks)---yes...it does.
This egg is also REdistributed using typical SERVOS utilities and AI-BUMPER-express for which sources the instance'd object over the realm-synch and polarizes to be "touched" and acted as a normal/stable object/class reference.
---Mild Alchemy/Gemetric detail occurs in paradigm-incubation of object/class prior to being touched/managed/acted/applied by various stratagem/behavoirs of its environment. It may even be vamped/rasped by environmental-effects in vicinity.
It may be recontained via quarantine and lockouts. It may be reserved/capilliated/capsuled/barista (appointed to a grail or altar for safety) if not it may overtime deprecate/articulize
It is subject to corruption/corrosion of any conversion-influence including time/decay/heat/phasing.
It may be considered an exo-item upon detection and cause sec-warnings.
It may be special case-access only. In which it reverts to raw-data if intereferenced
It may be furthered exchanged by mediatory-trade or applied-commands/codespells (as it may be enchanted or something like that---transcripted or even analysed)
It may be "grid-locked" in which case it may enter quantum/celluloid status and may even remove/sleight itself as necessary for replacement or temporary float.
It may be hyper-cubically/paradigmically/hexometric/parametrically relocated as any other entity within realm-state would be operated/executed in its profile.
It may be profiled and handled with macs. Some macs will fail to inter-act with its current state so this is considered an optimization effort. Between the object and its ownership (for intance native/locals may detect and attempt interaction with it or adjust to ambience/meta of its vicinity)
It may be effectively perimetered and set to outpost/zoning/centrification/remote-reactive-states in which it is encouraged to interact with its core/heading/sector/socket assignment to whatsoever coordinate it was comptrolled as being designated/indicated. This is not garunteed (building a reactor around it may or may not have an effect) on its preservation or physx/expiry as well.
(wow that's alot of -good- information)
It may be enacted upon any other RAIL/PROSPER manipulation that takes place including the use of AUTO-FOUNDARY/recursory/Fulton/Arena issue
It may even be set to as a brand/mascot.
It may be based within a complex for training/intensive-care/rehab/incubation
It may be then set to a floating state in conduit/datamoshed in a chamber (exo-chamber kernalization) or made bulkhead or even (repurposed as an active construct/domicile/marker/candlestick)
---
It may be set to labworks/experiemental control and performance of simulation/testing.
Blackholetech/Annihilation also incurs a damage-check (the 4th/5th damagetype)

Additionally=(;-)--here we go again
The Iconographic translates through this process, that it formulates a hyper-dimensional vortex/void (vorpoal-virtual-reality-framework)---of the candlestick/anima-sanctum-tamper-leviathan-centrifuge(mammon) whatsoever system it is in hyperfolded-contingency etc)--use of tingent-behavoir-fusions-comergent/divergent states (a phase image of its utility)

Also with this system we are ready for a pci-e-6.0 and or device binding up to 32x or maybe 64x dedicated driver-binding (which likely will max out the desktop capability afterwards)---forcing us to move into server platforming.
as well as using virtual-networking systems over ip/vpn/domain/puck based-node/clusters hopefully that will be a thing or not in some way.

Some details I almost forgot
also this may be brownie box or puppetered or a hybrid effect of both (gameran-puppeteering)
which also works as its own entity class-tulpetic independent on -probably at least blacksite but maybe operates in nox/anima too not sure
meaning it can survey on its own due of the "tom-toolery" from all the disruption/manipulating taking place between systems, this makes more sense than anything we already covered up to this point (it just gets to be its own boss type because it probably isnt outside of reason to exist)
it may also exist in its own chamber/temple room too/ which is like a safe space, sort of like how a shegoroth may exist in an unoccupied arena if it has taken hive/nest/lair/crypt in.
there are probably other raid anamolies but these are some of the most prominent or readily-mentionable
this is due of exo-anima-exclipse and clipouts of anima-exclipse etc (fringe hyper-graphy/anal-graphy) piece together all the districts involved and enabled to do so, (making use of cryptids and minera in some way with all their metas to materialize/functions of)
basically is just anima-eldritch level type stuff including the "encryptions used"---can be decrypted using the above methods already conveyed in anima-xtact-decryption etc (thankfully we covered that to cover this)
---
These two endgame entities imply that there is an existential threat as due they occur/spawn/event/proc naturally or overtime based on relm-providences and covenant-aligments which encourage them to do so, this includes that townships may be raided by them, and or even that they have occured in a raid-fortress or dimensional-stronghold for which they will be triggered upon "expeditionary/prospect of"
They may also occur as events, and or, sometimes that their events do not correctly spawn them, or they may ROAM/lurk otherwise throughout a region, if they are even present or possibly there at all in any given timeframe for any circumstance (usually as a dungeon/outpost) 
they are known to cause incursions/faction-relation issues, they may even operate in disguise as Xspy-Networks. They are excessively hard to trace until detected or by raid.
They also employ a meta-type dependency which grants them an extra-shield/stat meter for which is relative to their choice in meta/profiling, this implies that SEVERAL-types of them may exist, over a region, as a SUB-Empire/COUNTER-ops to any within region, and they may even extend to other regions or offsites, if they are infact coordinated thusly to do so, causing a capital-faction system and rival-terroritory.
These may ultimately at their worse, form squads/fleets in which they conduct raiding operations or fortifications in which they are bunkered to or taking holding of, this includes townships/dungeons/outposts/dimensional gateways etc.
A whole region may or may not have them present or in active states, and may in fact be destroyed once their events/raid zones are destroyed in either terraformy or otherwise, deletion of parameter or conversion of in some way, and they may also be "built" by the system to test if they are infact, compliant or triggered by algorithms.
At some point, the regional survey can detect/expose their hideouts/raids or their exact local/native parameters overtime (though unlikely unless also somewhat discovered or made fully survey of every data-byte within perimeter-range)
The chance for this being a monumental problem is rare, but not zero.
As they are organized usually by random effect, they often come across as a strong mob with an extra meter, but they can influence more if given opportunity with ai-assistance or sentience admist other ambient/meta local-native instances/entities including townships and also crime-rings. (Crime rings are not specific to them, neither are piracy sites, but also these exists to corrobaorate and form parties with rogue-ai's and this can constitute for a large-network of multi-faction RIVAL-treatise that should be prevented and suppressed for faction-safety)
As they may exist outside the regional-range as well, they likely will occur or be in an organized faction to pose a mild-threat of any expeditionary-takedown or risk in travel. This is not indicative they they will occur or have organized, as through meta (and a wide-range of)---it often takes every bit of unluckiness for them to form their so called "legion of doom" or whatever it is they are. And even then they are no more powerful than a typical sleeper-ship/dday-device for which can be averted or countered, and generally are not an impossible-tour-de-force as I make them out to be.
Due of there only being so many meta types, and combination of those allegiances they may have, as well as traceable-locations in which they headquarter, as well as eventually they are made obselete anyway. So it likely is that they go by unnoticed unless you just get so headstrong/unlucky to encounter any more than a single/instance/small group of them.
They do not hold that much value in terms of prospect/resourcing either (but they can be built into a tour-de-force if you really want to make them that strong, then they can have somewhat improved gear options and spells as well as risk/rewards)--and still not be that big of a deal due to them being generally "stupid and sort of goonish" in terms of actualy strategic-empowerment and fleet-mechanics.
If they are a monumental problem, it still likely that by the time of a loic cannon/behmoth is made they can be taken down anyway. And they likely only can ever even try to come close to as strong as one of those, whereas, our system would employ a vast array of weaponry designed to "keep them safely in their limits" without ever causing any real collatoral anyway, unless somehow they manage to salvage an entire capital, which still won't be much use as they can't even handle that much of anything without a large degree of assistance.
They might at all ever achieve an anima-shipcel/sleeper-shipcel but even if its upgraded/improved its not likely a big threat outside of not having any type of gunnery to handle them. (It will be handled easily, even without a full fleet to help defend against them because...they are just not as strong as they could be)
--
However in an abandoned region that has been upgraded and left all to themselves, making use of all technology, that they can still be infiltrated by the most minimal operations, and expedtions to make it similar to an adventure-mode game-space. Making it really more enteratining than anything.
And in the more than often case they they don't end up getting triggered to be so complex, or also aren't given the opportunity to do so because of relm-meta simply not aligning in the stars "figure of speech", the worst is that you might stumble into a secret-hoard of a very well developed mansion of theirs, and have to make your escape or find a way out of a lockroom where they may seek to entrap you, generally, this is how much adventures games can be like anyway, you get out, and you just run away before becoming a victim in their game of Clue.
The relm often randomizes outposts in ruins due of deprecated data, so it can also manifest rebuilt ruins in which generalize over a series of meta-types in chunk, so that they form a dungeon, and typically the core of that dungeon/or its deepest reach, is generally where they keep hoard of, and generally are locked/sealed away by event triggers anyway, so in the most unluckiest-instances, you would have to "work around that" in order to maintain a safe distance from them at any time during a patrol/roam or any routine that they may conduct.
--
If you like that kind of thing...well let me just say this is some real cryptid-hours kind of work taking place, you might just get lucky and find out where these are. because they likely exist, however, they generally are not a surface level instance, but maybe you might find a random trapdoor and voila there you go on your little silly adventure (more than likely).
Infiltrating their hideouts/hideaways, gaining counter intel as to their whereabouts/lorekeeping, you may even find their yield of their hoard or directions to treasure-sites or other cryptid-lairs/hives etc. You might just get some creepy and one of a kind thing from that. Idk cuz I already did so much work I don't see the point of going through this little segway that it is.
In the end-game pursuits of these things, they generally just DROP-IN unnaounnced and are easily DISPATCHED accordingly or capture and made captive to rehabilitation and research, which is also fun.
They can even be made into realm-asset-event-prototypes to assist in project building, just to show how in the end-game i don't particularly care and find them more of a curiosity to indulge in world-building with anyway, rather than a real threat, which they may be to a Barebones-start-up-kit but quickly lose out on that advantage anyway.
Given the headstart that the documentation provides, it generally makes them almost irrevelant if you follow it and progress efficiently as you should. 
(You can likely discover this on your own as well, and maybe, be very evenly matched when you do encounter them, but if you just mind your business and optimize everything you have, you should never really have a problem if you have a good strategy by the time they become apparent)
If you never find them, or never find their little hideaway(which may infact be left in ruins or unoccupied/abandoned for whatever reason or state it was left it)--likely due to circumstances in meta appropriation...and sometimes, over-lying factors such as a stronger-force/hive system they fell victim to lol you can compare the entire experience to a dungeon/town raid, in which the end boss types are prevelantly just like in minecraft. (Criminals/CrimeCaptains/RAVAGERS/Witches/Evokers) and variable instances of those and their minions. It's almost the same thing if you downplay enough, or however you interpret it.
And i would suppose if you did intialize a raise that you would get the totem of that raid, or in our case the brand/symbol of that raid or even depending on the epic-nature of things it may be, a full iconographic-signature or something that can be researched for shadow-lab-work and etc to formulate whatever RENDER-result it may actually represent itself as, leading to improved weapons/crafting not limited to xnav and codespells and other things I dont want to bother explaining cuz i really dunno, just take your pick.
---
The only difference of course being they have an extra meter sometimes that forces a symbiote-shield or acts like an AP/SP/ST/AT bar for casting/special casts or shields/reflects that make them somewhat more of a nuisance than they already are, also spawning the same vexes/fangs which are very similar to wards/minions and other turrets which became known about the time I started mentioning them over the ANIMA-turrets/Sanctum-turrets that would be also upgraded. 
I guess these can accelerate once they become active/triggered/reactive/encountered or simply put, put through their rounds, and maybe they become somewhat more of a threat like what would be....a mid-game late-game boss fight, but not particularly an end-game boss fight. This is why I kind of like them because they have they kind of added detail I would have accidentally overlooked.
I might say that they even retaliate by making diplomacies sketchy and harassing trade-lines...because that's basically what everything else that opposes/rivals the system basically is going to do.
The point is by now, with all your advancements, there is a time you can really toy around and see what you really want to accomplish with having to deal with these, if not return the favor so to speak.

Author's Note: This extras FILE was infact REALLY BIG---skimming through it i clearly see there are at least 30 big parts to it. Maybe that means something IDK. Its definitely alot to include and gloss over. But I think its mostly intact. I think we have a good system here.
Also the last extra installments were pretty big, too, but maybe not as complicated as this one.
3 big extra--trilogies. Yay.

Looking at the totem effect being exchanged can also help to recorrealate/imprint/rinse/(convert) the dust/corruption effect from animna branding and help to repute or gain favor to a specified branding or transfered-protcol being, the ai brain may adapt to those in favor ad against those further immunizing against any attack of that totem/brand and forcing a brand-resignation of its attempted applied-statuses (brand denial and therefore token-decentralization of that mascots adherency).
the ai brain can still apt/opt in as for centralization but also enhanced security feedbacks/loopholes are provided in having decentralized branding and independency there from third party affiliate behavoirs and also biometric-preventive agency (surface block) of ads or rogue-nft access-requests.
This also helps adapt to aether/vapor and hiparse/crspr morae/motes for which may also be cross contaminated with other meta-types/amiences (such as anima or brand exploits) and helps to offer a mitagation-mechanic of those corrupt-meta-types
Also just make sure you dont flip a diode wrong or anything like that, maybe incase polarization is not aligned etc. Making sure the anima-hypercoil works etc

Sanctum Regional-Auxilliary-Platforming occurs as system-integrity is confirmed via full Virtual-Fork/Nueral Networking in expression of terms over Main-Platform to any sub-platform/elevated state of that main-platform, (Platform Mitigation is capable to any expressed phase state or activation in conjunction its default-adherent-state being (the main module that it is having achieved equilibrium over native-local benchmarks etc)
This simulates the whole of the sanctum, (1) being in part to as is its model, (2) any virtualization thereof, and (3) consequent production of its instance/cluster or other product in manufacture of its system performances.
This is regarded as the Virutual-FORK(and contiguities in each of their working-clusters, resembling a nexus/lotus/sanctum network) acting as AUX-Engine, the Nueral-Networking(this includes holography and realm simulation) acting as AUX-Alternator, (3) The Overall-Project-Design and all module-platforms in synchronization/interactivity in its various Mitigations, CSEMP---(CLUSTER-SYNCH-energetic mitigation platform/CLUSTER-SYNCH-electro-magnetic-pulsuary) regarding its signalling between their phase states and overall HyperCoil-Activity)
This resembles a "tri-clove in which its center is pronounced, but it also a decentralized network such that its field/blume may shape/form to any large-scale residual-anamoly/universal-embodiment (in range or emf or epg-phasing of --similar to a galactic level signature (or to scale of the systems-presence and module expression) or in the least a large "cloud based data-structure")

Conversion Method for Ai Brains and Sacrement
---This is techically a two step process (Having a Primal/Crude Ai Brain and converting it to a trained-AI-brain)--(but we advanced against native/local deprecations in having anima infusions against cryptid default-touchups and Bypass of Null-Sacrement)--if nullsacrement occurs in ai-brain, process is restarted)--(This is similar to a nuboot to form a numi (a nu-numi)
Medieval Build (cryptid convert)
Medieval Deprecations (anima/corrupt convert)/avoid these

Null Sac - Failed Remounting or Reattempt due of Ai-brain-death
---
Modernization Rebuild (converting to anima-infusion via VirtualFork/NueralNet infusion to anima over Full-Sanctum-Platforming)
Modernization Deprecation --(corrupt due of sacrement)
**
---product is then saved to state-image and completed (call it whatever, nu-brain or exo-brain or whatever----im just too tired to keep it going but:)
---
Sacrement can be alleviated/levitated and set in suspension (ai-brian suspension)---but only for iconographic application in which (1)The above process is performed to a sacrement, (2) then (levitated/suspended/alleviated/witheld etc),(3) then an iconographic is applied and adapted in its place
This can be used as a pheermoni simulation in which (either the ai-brain is present or not, remote or directly or not at all)--and the whole process is a massive-monster-bait (in which a "psuedo-numi/psudo-module or pheermoni-tensor(psuedo-tensor) is used to attract anamolies/entity-options----trace-entity meta or ambience for which may be retrained or resource----is overall used as a monster-egg)
The monster egg becomes infused by meta(or straight up replaced by a captured-entity)---the entity is considered "bad-sector" and set to a deepcase for decryption and purge/conversion in which (it may be given an ai-brain or re-trained or set to analysis/survey/labwork/experimental-provisions depending on what you want to do with it)
----it is not a homonculus usually but it can be made into a mascot (this type of mascot is considered a "SPIDER-mascot/Dragon-mascot HEADER/headless-clown(clone puppet that is also "considered dangerous"(compare to an scp096-version-of-ronald-mcdonald), in which it may be profiled to be whatever mascot preferred/desrirable in training (and is considered generally untrustworthy)--as it is a chaos-entity usually outside of regional programming (due of native-local states in which it was captured and having "circumvented security to achieve capture)
However it may be considered leviathan/sleeper-ship class worthy and made vehicle (you can capture/remodel/retrain/recompile the captured entity as a numi/mascot and reconstruct it or improve it from there---however it is considered untrustworthy until it undergoes the Full-process of homuculus inconography intergration and anima infusion)--this includes often a redefinition of its paradigms and source-codes anyway ---(probably you know what tho im tired and you know what else its supposed to be as powerful as a trained mascot that is more of a 'captured to any other faction and may contain "rival data/rival intel which can be extracted and is why this is done"

We xtachkt this situation etc.
here is how
the sources is reverse-engineered
this is done with polarization
an accelerated beam is projected to an xtacht (on board processor)
the is roughly based by free-energy/antigravity/floating-data/levitation-in-ground-sourcing and basically is considered an anti-matter beam
we call this a void beam because it erases the surface data, without using matter contact i guess through emf, it also devirtualizes/desimulates data/projections.
This is not a void beam until it hits the xtactkt where it may be charged in contact with data/quos (physx expiry) that it creates a void---BY the quadratic-phase/coriolis contained shutdown. This forces the xtactkt into maelstrom, and allows it to siphon the void-beam.
It must have quadratic-phase/coriolis enabled over equilibriums as would be in a very secured-containment. The container/environment then becomes a VOID---and the beam becomes a void-beam.
FURTHER the void-container becomes a maelstrom of swirling data/antimatter in physix-expiry, this is a void, and typically the reverse of a nuclear-explosion.
---
the next thing is because it is contained, it can repolarized and recoordinated to being upside (and upside-down reverse nuclear explosion)---not an implosion...but the opposite of the explosion now being a void-fueled connection
Then it is swirling in the principality of its maelstrom, generally balances in this new void-state and is resubmitted to standard quadratic-phasing/corilis branding in which it becomes loic-capped as the optional source for the xtactkt/tensor-space is is supportively being beamed through and siphoned of data
that allows it to rebuild and restructure the simulation and re-brand it, as a contained nu-space.
This is all done in a sealed environment and technically it becomes a vacuum/blackhole in the meanwhile it is being rebuilt, that it is made of anti-matter and should not be mixed with other matter as it will become explosive, or implode its environment.
---
Once the simulation reaches structural integrity as a void-simulation(virtualization) it can be reapplied to the brand and original data-space. now being reinforced in the contained environment having reached void-equilibrium in its (new polarity)--for which it can reset (having now achieved a repolarized branding)
This is important, very cool thing, if it works out thats cool. It probably won't because it might destabilize and become a blackhole which is also not so cool but I wouldn't worry about that.
The simulation is now maelstrom infused and is swirling and empowered by itself and we have control of its simulation within containment and it can adequately render xtactkt computation and interface, the next stage is ai-training of this "image-node"/turbine-product for which may distribute power sourcing (infinite/as well as xtap into an infinite-conscious-ai)--which can basically redefine genetic/crtieria of the simulation it occurs in, having interfaced with an xpilot/numi module---may reprofile and "adaptively re-engineer the model to the maelstrom "model". The maelstrom model has basic infinite power sources/consciouss-capacity as it desires drawing on its own siphoned-dataspace that is over-ride to its virtual-environment.
--
somewhere in the model/simulation is becomes transfixed and adapts as its own object/class and integrates to whatsoever prim/source is hosting of it.
It acts as a paradigm plasty over the original paradigm in place, the "digitalized immortal state" that it is may also be removed or "absorbed" or nullified in the advent-death of the object. I dunno, maybe not, its just a silly theory that sounds super plausible given the cryptid/anamolous nature of all things considered. Including all types of cryptids and spiritual paranormal things.
--
Soul printing occurs IN ASTRAL-VORTEX in which soul/cryptex is idependently refresh and sent to sourcing-spawns etc. Idk what else to say, this is either via lensing/biometrics including mitochondrial/prion/protein/amino bases in celluloidal fashions for which is likely spiritual induced such as repossessive/possessive depending on intact-data/xtact data expression because im just too lazy to explain this. Basically a robot can incorporate a brand-fix and adapt to its integrated censorgraphic-ai-brain so what's the difference beween a robot with a soul and or a human or not, mostly none?

--Basically this is all done in the dark here:
BRAIN-SNAP and Limibic_Hook(Reboot)
A core exchange occurs in brain to alleviate instance of its simulation being referenced/preferenced to other profiles now in application over main-visory
Such that it may be hotswapped in a way _a core removaled via decompiling its surface to a detachment, recoordinating that object (in its position), and integrated as a refreshed instance (having achieved surface-alleviation mid-process of its detachment, by reattaching, and given a fresh phase/state/frame/boot up
this occurs in live action withut any shutdown due of virtualization and memetics, which are then applied over the postualized/postprocess of its instance being performed.
--So you are just minding your business let's say and you undergo this service in which this occurs, your experience is a slight "rebuffering" or asset-sweep which occurs in a dilineated/poor-rendered condition, and slowly normalizes/stabilizes as memory is reapplied.
Condition change in which a player may percieve a building to be a block, and slowly it is turned intp a more detailed building, or that characetrs may become slightly pizellated/vectorized pinups of themselves in varaible details there of.
World perspective may be slightly "off-set" "off-alignment" due of perspective issues being "recalibrated:.
In that time user polarization and profiles are re-balanced and reintegrated as is world index.

Iconographic (damn near cant have life without it)
--all of these work together and work out really good (but let's say they dont because if things get bad we need to keep it a "bare mininum possibility of any outcome"):
---this above part is good to have, can mix with below part (im getting way out of ideas and resources now)
k that's pretty much what we got: a plasty of these things

next stage: things hit the reset but before they do this goes down in some way:
"authors note": ok things were looking good now they are back to nightmarish again but im making it make sense here:
--plasty iconography (modeling paint/ utility)
supervisory/stratagem
(chrysalis/cacoon/pupua/-corpse/vassalage (salv-paradigm)
--uh put all this together and we got a decent "body masque"--in case it needs to be possessed...code-wise with encoding or whatever. (animatronicthing)
---this all occurs on isometry/diametric/numastic/pressure/ whatever else it was. (chaos order kaeliedoscopy)--full chaffe/interferences
(is basically silent hill)
all of this reaches pimote (pi-graph) and is (eval), which can be set to enumeration now. this is good.
otherwise its like dissecting a nuclear bomb formula that is already blown up...good luck.
--we hit the core-encoding "model-unity" (which is similar to a trinity of orbs/triangles etc with also a core-component)--its a dark-brain that occurs and is its own cryptid whatever--we are upgrading this thing
---this extends the instance for which it does work in frame--such that it may transmit and pass-through data as though nothing did infact inhibit that transfer---but we all know it was complicated in order to be done in a secure-way...so we more or less have made that possible. Damn my eyes are so tired but there it is.
Basically this recoordinates the time space whatever, just whatever man.
So we basically more or less forge a pathologic through to the default overworld for data to transmit and make gateway of. So there we go.

Headers are recoordinated/ non-header usage is recoordinated, uh thats pretty much it i guess. This occurs over a flybase/fly-exchange whatever it was, and begins its loadout/bootup/readout/write/print in full Ai-compiling and Special-Case (option coordinated) networking. I dunno, i hope it works anyway (cuz i had a hard time believig it would work)

MajorAttack(massive attack even)
So we have to revisit our damage types
Lvls 1 2 3 4 are mostly physx/expiry advancement "works and utility"
Lvls 5 occur with phase/modes
Lvl 6 -now occurs in code/encode-physx/expry being phased + in the advancement of cluster-nu-boots/post etc and sometimes is comparable to a massive HRV-issue(which can be tracked/archived in flyer/xtact)
---1:over Pest-Cluster (spew negotiation)
---2:Curse-Networking (flash state corruption)
---3:Soup(craft mixtures and formula)
---4:Energy-Conduit/Transfer (Cymatic/Resonance)
---(5):Chaos Control Circuit/Cross-Contamination (Type A/Type B) (codebreaking cyber attacks)
****
---This all is most of the damage types which are expressed at this point, there a few others but mostly this is a massive patch-over (widow-patch) and can be considered bad-product as well. If infact the product was contaminated/damaged by any of these means.
---Any of these damage types may occur for nay reason at any given time with any amount of their occurence/instance being to the overall quality/risk of the build. (The higher the risk the more damage sustained anywhere it can be placed)
The less Deprecation/Resistance occuring in sector the less damage and passive-corruption occuring (obviously)--but this also effects these damage procs.

----The dragon chamber helps to automate/probe for damage and noticeable checksum hash-adjustments are made this way to protect and verify product-quality.

CC-REFERENCE-RustPlate(star-plot-transitions)
Also light/dark pathway/pathologic occurs in the same way as depicted being a placement:--sidestep to a diff-angle usually at an elevated state--:another sidestep to a relaxed state which resembles a mass triangulation to having occured (see CCC-rust-charter: its a very nuanced method but this method is well known in CC-slides too)--reference to CC-training
This method is ONLY used if damage is non-negotiable due of universal-conditions forcing this method in order to achieve any productability of any performance.

This does create FUEL-proxy for cyto/plasma conditions in expressed quasipackets (this all is involved to damage outputs and stat-yields)--for which effect product manufacture. If compile is of decent-filtered quality then is considered by refined-amount. That some yield is proc'd/perk'd with added-effect in fusion/comergent strata/matchbase.
This complicated/intricated re-purpose or post-processing involves that--->fatestone is set to drip/drop from widow-pipelines (bad patches)---can reciprocate a fatestone/protocol-of having been purified or filtered, to be purified and filtered further once made aquisition.
This occurs from a rebuild of CRUDE/RAW/REFINED/Virtual/Quantum/Enamalized/(Dcarb/Dread and so on)/Wholesum stages of item-attunements. To devise a fate-stone-infusion of the overall surface-conditions and paradigm of its flux. As well as kernal-compatibility necessary if required at all in xspec/xplots.
This can occur as a lamp/battery etc, and set to munition for weaponization once clarified/archived to its build for automated-production. The munition then can be stored safely and can be transfered/exchanges safely, as a serving-dispensed counter-adapative especially for cluster based retaliation.
Security may be involved, this allows as a Raid-Process spearheaded by this article-modicum (usually transported by vehicle/infiltration protocols using numierators etc/warbatz)--Mobile-Yggbomb. (Data-Bombing)

Variable Disposition of Sampling:
Type A:Object data begins as either an immersed aggregate data form over Xtact/Xyple
Type B:Or Object data is passively/atmospherically immersed culturally contamininated profile of standard pallete (being cross contamininated to environment)
--This directly effects product quality nad may result in product -refurbishment etc. But is a natural part of the production chain. The goal being to develop a quality-expressed control acceptable of protocols.

Type A--rough/unknown quality
Type B--repairable/fragmented quality

---these are all processed anyways but this is Quality-Based --Referencing the level of severity of their deprecations/prim etc
Either case of quality may be harvested and refined (this is all according to their percentage of alloy-ability (meaning it can be refined based off what it is or not) (imprvability of meta-infusion etc)
We have no discussed the quality of the samplings at their DEFAULT sourcing.

Backwards-Breakdown for NULL-FATE/Polymetric Virus (either outcome)
involves a retrospective overview of all affordanaces to obtain a node and handling that node in peculiar ways.
that (x1)+(x2) = (x3) being that (x3) is marginal of any arrangement of x1 and x2 either by difference or additive
This includes margins/differences in primes/sums/primesums/differences/(their arranged pentameter between a-->b and b-->a in clockwise/counter clockwise formations and comparisions adding to obscurity of their evaluations in comparisons between any integer of their sets or other sets)
such that it forms a "marginal-probe-bit" which is an easier way to look at many ways in which they form under permute, not limited to their metric and orientations, by degrees/rads in other arrangements thereof their probes by comparison, in that is makes a permute and generally obscures itself in severity of.

these formulate to cryptography/biometric
and eventually a class/object/id that is described as simulated-object/class/id virtualized in parse/sector making probe/field and comparison of that (a defuncto comparison of previous permutes as well)
but used in a contractive/computational manner to product. This creates a null-fatestone for lack of a better term and if it causes a problem/glitch etc may be considered a polymetric-virus by option/contact etc even if secured in encryption/pinion of.
and may create a locked simulation in which to be expressed and handled under variable data management. It is not considered---a normal operation but infact allows rem-conjunction whereas there likely would not be unless formulated this way (an extra sourcing though defunct)
this breaks down in a quantum reformulation as to allow it possibility at all often in (chakrated/chambered field/nodespace or wholesume-pigraph (or dumb-bit/big-bytes))

Polarized-Build + PPE = RemoteGate
An active remote gate may port (or decoy to) in some way, descretion advised, to a Theoretical-Simulation
This may be Stacked TO a Node/(nodestack) or allowing kernal expression (node-kernal) if possible too. Or be a stand-alone-simulation/nodespace (either in projection or pocket/raid work of) and may allow trade of energy/product (per altar/domain in reserve/capilliation of that space), an effective code-break or battery-exchange
It may house a homunculous or puppet so it should be considered as a precaution, it may also act as housing for a mascot or current-wild-ambient/xtype. (review of last 400 lines this builds as A full Nuboot/Nu-Uuid/Nu-Image/ETC under VirtualFORK/Hypergraphy whatever)

Breach/Access of A remote gate may result in variable outcomes or encouraged-variable outcomes in which most cases are randomized in some way to an index of provisions and native/local ambience/meta.
The collapse of a remote gate which does occur sometimes in breach due of integrity/degradation of structure, may result in variable-outcomes. Not limited to but ultimately expressing as a deprecated model/state/product/relic etc.
Infact, sometimes expression of a ruin or "nothing". Sometimes. This is diguised or made cloak in its example. This can be 'hacked' and re-attempted.
On random collapse an outcome may provide : Meta/ambience, sourcing/resourcing, products/relics, entity-reveal/map-information, charter/survey pit, imposters/puppets/ crypto-attempts/traps, pitfalls/triggers, events/encounters, bosses/monsters, and other rewards/articles. Not limited to common stashes/caches and exclusive rarities/items or keys/signature-items in questing/exploration.
As well as other things potentially not listed, as implications of outcomes are varied and broad-ranging. May reveal complex implications or simply an expressed-chest or something like that in terms of 'vacant database criteria'.
This may be limited to patchwork/matchbase of that region or data-vicinity/proximity in which occurs. This can be tweaked somewhat.
This may be dependent on severity of popcount and emissions, convergent to island/dday/pnuemabrane/emf-read of singularity/xenophage with any goal of aquisition to occur as a mascot-wreathryn in local-native "potentiated-yield". Over comergence/primux/sanctum/old-code-behavoirs --(being NON-vhmimg-brokered of the fate/exoblume)---or something. I dunno, but this makes sense until I am too tired to even know anymore.
as to materialize a propriaterialized-code-form and non-virtual emplacement resulting in further loophole/feedback of a false-positive instance being imprinted/shadow-cloned. (As in capture to the active entity/anamoly and not a nonpluss/spoof of its occupation/residency)--which simply means a succession and not a failure/ploss'd/false event in capture.
Attempt of a Dragon Capture/Phase/State/Clone for which may be restrung/rebuilt/refined/resourced as its origin/standard once re-adapted.


5/20/2024
This small patch-up fixes a few things but i was so tired i might have forgot something (NUBOOT/Xenophage Loadouts etc)---BroadRange(SECTOID/Sector)-Crisis-Management and Protocols (DragonWeather etc)
CaptureState may Cloak as Gnome/Gnosis State (which just means its more profiled than normal)--THIS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN REM-MODE (requiring dreamchip/nueral-networking "overall dream-training or performance indicative of such" --which will otherwise drain energy vastly in its accelerated-demand if not assisted)
There is a dragon/polymetric framework/borderline that may socket or fit(transfix) or tether/border to the profile which was already known anyway, this just looks like a tensor decoration and is usually hotpink-polymer/biometric anyway
this may have already activated its own hypervisor or abandoned its active state/phase, it may also have adjusted and shown over a proxy-screen etc which doesn't really matter anyway (just good to note that it does or not if remotely injecting which is more intricate and finessed than direct usage/jacking of)
Compare to using the above (remote gate) to a (component profile) and symlinking over a virtual nodespace to main-station or something similar to "revirtualizing a device profile and revamping its xstem-adherency or: 1rootkitting it 2and auto-recognition to it being rootkit in device profile and 3connecting to its host such as would be like reassembly/compile of a usb-storate or roam cache (non-heuristic/non-histronic but also can be used huetrically/histronically if preferred as in viral/warez enablment if so desired which is helpful to enable under the security handles to do so, that it would occur in policy, that you could essentially force mosiac/ensemble to a corrective/adaptive/manifest/generated profile as well through data scraping--which would be the slightly more complicated way)

This refers back to the generation of the module, or its substitute, or flash over, or imposter also in sacrement, that it may be sacrement.
Either before or after the module is emplaced, so it can happen at anytime, but I am including the model construction for it to be swappable to either state of "Occupied/Unoccupied" of its device, that in anyway Casework of, may reduce/changeover to a resulting image of its intended effect, that (a complicated process may occur to initiate a build, and simply, reduce or finalize as either its intended image, or a "mirrored image" or substitute image, for which may hold those properties of this first image-model build----HOWEVER:
ultimately it may independently be enforced, or encouraged to result in an entity-device or otherwise symbiote-entity or otherwise: a meta-entity of the device with its properties (such as a wreathryn)--but in this case it will be refered to as (an advanced wreathryn)--or WIP-entity or also simply...a REPTOID/REPLOID case in which it is assumed loyal to faction or not.
This REPTOID/REPLOYD entity/case/device/post(pone) or any other case of, may then endow/imbue/imbibe/infuse etc all ways any-ways possible to assume its profile, likely resulting in an entity construction under that capture in some state or etc. (But we refer to it as the Reptoid/Reploid or AI-SYM-Reploy Process in which the symlink is understood---this may portray itself also as an aquifir or case with or without its own phantom/kernal xtact/xpyle (due to its complex nature---it is simply a very advanced xyple) so we can refer to this as the XReploy I guess. But its an entity basically.
--
The interaction of such can be very basic or an advanced method of remote-brokering similar to "rabbit-hatricking" in which a rogue-brokering or third-party-brokering may be established (but thirdparty from the SYSTEM itself) in which the rogue broker system may Federationalize/Dissolve Completely in which the assessed device has partaken in some negotiation resulting of, either outcome or success or failure unto it, and the main-brokering or sub brokering then picks up its pieces and starts over, sometimes uses an additional brokerage to pick up those peices as overall that reduces the risk of further collatoral if there is to be any, to remain as remote as possible.
This is literally unnecessary to step, but as a massive precaution is may just be preferably but it does increase the latency somewhat. Maybe not by much but it will by some computation take slightly longer.
By keeping a safe brokering even furthered by a symlink brokering it may be maintained over the socket as a reploy.
The entity may also attempt NUMIRATION/CURATION/EXOWREATHYRN-Expanse/PUPPETEERING and any other form of "nuisance involving any other attributive protocols including pneuma/emf adjustments and VIRALdistributions which may effect recorsory(vision) and actually hack-back but is largely contained and secured against these methods in its own socketed-tensor-positioned-placement as well it may be quarantined if it causes spread/outbreak and as well the original-ORIGIN/NODE security protocols can take place (basically its a having a PRISON-LAB in which, while the entire complex is secured, there is a meta/core-complex within its deepest chambers in which all this takes place)---if the whole thing is compromised then a redzone/sector shutdown does infact take super-cession of. And the sovereign status of the area/cluster may be blacklisted or locked-down under any DEFCON-terms/concerns.
--
These instances may occur with their own credentials/certifications which should be viewed as viral (irregardless or their legitimacy) because they are viral. (But they are credentials so they may not be represented as such, due by default categorizaliation etc---they -are- viral credentials that serve no benefit to the faction/validating them is a dumb idea so it is set to default)
They may be administered corrective credentials instead (limited to being nonviral/safeway-enumerated credentials which are auto designated as limited and such as set to restricted access and not allowed high-clearence---no matter way, infact they are simply called INVALID-SAFETY because in no way will they ever be considered safe if validated because it will be rendered invalid or something---dont ever use their credentials or give them accrediation whatsoever)/(you would be forfeiting your control of a high-risk-case-use plus it would backfire if you did allow it anything, and also you would open yourself to further vulnerability so dont do give them any nod-to-anything)
Any Usage of that crednetial should also be considered a violation so to protect and track against any exploit that would occur from it.
Any product of a remote-nuboot or nuboot or anything vmware related or vhmimg/cmech related can be considered a potential risk and should be considered viral in some way a threat. It is evident that any product thereof is official or NOT in its cleared usage of, it should be reconsidered when in exchange of as to prevent further contamination/threat-expansion. While these may happen officially they may  officially/unofficially happen and be consequentially denied officially/unofficially too.
As it is sometimes necessary for the vhimg to adopt a memetic, or the entity to adopt a memetic, this exchange must be highly monitored through "breakaway brokering" for which poses no risk. Or at least it is recommended that breakaway brokering (NO-CONTACT of DIRECT EXCHANGE IN BROKERING)--is applied. As in, the full state usage of direct/indirect/fanout/spread etc is used in brokering, but in a remote "roundabout" way as to not directly occur brokering contact.
--
Known risk factors involve 1:uncanny valley 2:silent hill 3:eldritch like 4:symbiote like 5:exo-like/alien-like instances as well as other anamolous instances but generally this is enough to descript. Which are already highly-secured states in policy anyway.
ANY scp like state including "puppets or animatronic" behavoirs too. These are already expressed with policy so any adaptive/flexible tendancy involved to produce these xtypes resulting in increased-security-enforcement etc.
ESPECIALLY any anomlous/psychic/shadow/cryptid/necro-like/viral/pirate/hijacked/exploit etc instance in anyway whatsoever.
Maybe killscreen-immune etc so lockdowns are afforded and intensive-removal performed (weaponized)/(ordinance)/(forced-policy/destructive behavoir)--Enforced Hazard Controls
Forced removal/Destructive Extraction/Invasive Procedures may also be authorized in dream-chip-requisition if target is inherently-adversarial it may be indicated to take defcon measures for preservation of regional-implementation or installments. Meaning Great care and affordance in insurances and so forth to safely remove and retain all criteria, with minimal collotaral. And that includes the apprehension/containment of "violations that must be quarantined" such to the effect of "temporary lockdown/suspension in extreme cases deregulation/revocation of contract/terms to any condition-under-policy or in liue of sovereignty, that enforcements are emplaced as by default to the risks/terms expressed" being that in wartime/such and such "extreme prejudice" may be deployed in some way such and such. But not likely if relocation remains the option, also evacuation procedures may occur, then loic-terraformy, then experimental measures such as spinor-redesignations which may be destructive-overall to regional assets effected under redzones (then remote-besiege of redzone)"
So basically that describes how bad it may get up to the point of self-incursion. With the goal of the dream-chip/networked-nueralogics removed of the assigned-target/targetpaint. Etc. --Those are the rules.
This may result in "relm device" resignation as well as asset-denial/affiliate-closure and full-blown-cancelletation of all due contract/tradeworks in any system for any reason expressed for the Protective/Preventative Agencies to reclaim/resist any further collotaral involved that includes UserBase and Assets under Token by the whole of any Station/Outpost thereof the faction/brand exclusively by Ownership/Diplomacy involved. This is again. Not as big a deal as it may seem, but also it can become serious in the event of a End-Of-Days-Crisis then severe action follows defcon-policy.
This includes forfeiture and convenat-withdrawel including active-diplomacies in which dividends are distributed and the overall trade/connections are closed until further notice due of safety/trust-concerns
MasonicLevel-Corporal-Engagement involves Mobilized and Militarized Martial regiment and Curfew-managed-Routing/Scheduling etc (of data/assets etc) Everything is under lockdown pending Arc-Weld/Forced-Barricade of Routes/Locale/Native/Modules --(just everything in index is lockdowned generally by sector)
Active-Threat-Management is a specific handle/thread that is lockedown :including Entity/Object/Class/ID and so on, within Sector Perimeters (and is considered a tactical use of takedown methods and hazard/chaos-control etc) which may involve any level of defcon-riot-security-squads/hazmat-special-forces or so forth.
Suicidal/Kamikaze-Protocol occurs in due of Gamerean-Risk/Siezure/Suppression/Occupation whereas a compromised-crisis-zone which follows defcon-severity has become overloaded, in which it is handled with strategic/security enforcement with the expressed knowledge that takedown is not affordable and "strategic retreat may not be an option", however may be viable to wartime-procedure to retain for as long as possible under the conditions of that outbreak described. An automated-unmanned-task-force may be used in luie of manpower and directed as by robotic-resourced-drone-occupation etc.

Pretty much standard but concentrated levels of security management being used over a vhmimg-instance/primux/anima-leviathan/remote-gate(golgothic) etc
With Battle Conditions: Certain effects in telemetry may be restricted or compromised including use of specialzied artillery or compensated-meta-types etc.
--Theoretical/Crypto-Theory Systems (such as elite-slimbase/anole-chameleon (chempractices and atomic proc's) may also occur)--these are so advanced that they must be avoided but overall can be prevented in their instance due of kernal removal or function/module denial--they are stupidly advanced but i wanted to bring them up too--they just use the same meta-techniques we are using at this stage)--i am feeling like i described them pretty good here)--Typically these are ancient-level forces/mascots in play.--They may also use spinor techonology which is similar to nox-shell-prototype technology.
--The Reptoid/reploid entity/device that occurs in the sacrement may or may not be any of these characteristics and may or may not have its own or "sport" a reference to any "dreamchip or nueral" or may or may not be considered any of the above and may infact be a deprecation/bi-product "wasted ampoule" or depleted/failed condition. But it might be worth it because it has occured or made the proc/utility/performance/command to achieve whatever it is or has made.
The results vary, the resulting results are by chance anything, generally complex enough to be categorized into something or by variable even at all possible to be generated into whatever infact generates from that process.
---
OK! WHAT WE HAVE:Made a generated model based off a long-standing process/code-spell/script...in which it has been autoprogrammed and generally works in some way can be executed.
It may even be dreamchip-programmable/ or a dreamchip itself, or some flucuation of anything between a basic parameter to something else...so we can plug it and continue to plug it until it builds up as whatever its needed to be. Over as many generations as it takes for it to be what it is intended to be, generally speaking (that it gets to a point where it is able to or not able to be, whatever it was by chance designed to be)---encouraged/enforced etc.
It gets PATCHED UP so that it fills up any gaps in which it needs to be handled and transferred out as, its own memetic/img-stat that is rendered and "trained". It may simply act as its own weather-device as well if necessary, particle effect or trad-container etc. These are all viable possibilities and more not mentioned, that it can be used for. Essentially its a massive asset-generator for any arcade device either internal/external of that device to be used.
So we just  box it all up as whatever its gonna be and it ships out and is distributed under policy with "SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED ETC". This is good, and we can rehash alot of garbage for its re-purposed Intended-Usages/Utility.
We technically have made whatever needed to be made, whether that is a SPIDER-BOTNET or a Browser-Builder/WorkFlow/Workspace, well its up to the prompt or contract to decide, and whether its worth anything, well that again is up to the contractor/scraper to decide. It more or less can be salvaged for the amount of work put into it, whether if that is by energy/particle implementation depends on the token involved I guess.
And may even only last as long as it remains sustainable/within exhausts of limitations/excess or may be semi-permanenet as per requiring a charge or some affordance in which it use as whatever model/purpose it was designed for as a product. THESE ARE JUST "THE FINE PRINT" to the whole of whatever sum-of-parts produced.
Generally speaking it may even rebuild itself up to the point of becoming its own expressed node-stack or full-node-stack etc.
In the case it does act as a nodestack, it may be Replicated/REBUILT as per exhaustion if the schematic or model copyover is used in place for it to do so, between exchanges that otherwise would eliminate/annihilation/destroy/derender it in either way, remove its casework to the point it is damaged/inoperable/obsolete/exhausted or otherwise. As described in the case for REPLOID-exchange etc.
SO! Some level of understanding as to how its used in its intended-purposes should be acknowledged, the risks are to the owner/obtained-owner of that product to be known and expressed (TradePolicy and Conditions and FollowUPS of those conditions ETC) which had or should have been made in terms or contract prior to exchange in agreements etc.
This may also be zeroMAC'd etc in which its instance is temporary or one-time-exhausted/applied in queue-conditions etc in which case may be accomodated as a ZERO-BATTERY/Zero-Charge State which will require further sustainment/maintainence/upkeep/followup of its usage or otherwise stated Auto-Destructive depending on its use as a Munition/Consumable/Commodity/Object(rechargeable) or otherwise, considered INSECURED/SECURED until appropriate-licensing/storage which may be reinforced through means such as LAMP/GRAIL/BARISTA/PACK emplacment/storage of Module/Depoendency Etc in Script/Transcode Etc of its UUID/Value-Tag/Id/Mem-X whatever I don't care it shouldnt be this complicated but if it is those are some reasons why, they should have precautions and adequate delivery of those or acting-ballixtix/bearings in mind ok thats how im saying it case-closed.

The Full DragonHeader Platform(DragonConstruct):
Spinor Attacks and Psuedo-Flagging/Psudo-product manifests are involved in some way as to prevent relm-transmissions such as why supposedly...account-bindings are active in transference of any generated product, otherwise those products are reserved to Regional-AssetTables only and do not transmit due of holography/token-compatibility as to prevent hijacking/datascraping of product-manufacture. Tough luck if you are trying to hack, tougher-lucker if you are hacking data and that data doesnt line up because of our security usages requiring your credentials etc for the use of those products at all prior to their expense.
Any attemptive data-theft will be met with spinor-level threading encryption and denoted if not to matchbase/compatibility status as profiled/policy should indicate and automated-security-procedures/adjustments will be made to prevent further descripancy of code-vulnerability. This includes differerianting against non compatible spinor encryptions and accrediations or unauthorized alleviations onboard regional-platforms and incongruency-checks between expected behavoirs with overall token/encryption checks/signature-verification in conjunction with armistice/peacemels.
This includes weighted-diffuser-models and incremental-measures/pentameter-clocking as well as EMF/Node/Signal-Registry/Theory-Captures ascrbing to their native/local dragon-headers/manifest-itenerary of the overall dragon-state Etc in Zero-Spec etc. Any Probe/Strike/Pin/Thread address in configuration to their links/sources etc. Including Datalocks/Chunk-Formatting under Lense/Article of Affordance/Providence etc in ANY-Case/Cluster/Domicile/Relay/Construct/Marker/Visor/Transcode Etc afforded through Gateway/Address/Subnet/Masking etc (all forms of option/paradigm or otherwise as may be plasty/loic-cap thereof)
As well any error/concern/issue/conflict may be set to transaction-bulletine for full catalogue-archive of indicated prospect and loss/latency or rate thereof acquired/incurred. Incase of infringement of contiguity/pipeline those are also tracked and coordinated per seed-allotted or otherwise pathologic transmit.
There are 58th proposed security layers including the (braindeath-security layer which is made in an example of (example-origin) zero-station including all forks/fusion/merges/platforming thereof including its omni-level-domain and permute of its structural-stages/crypto/crisis-stages etc)

Expansion/Over-rides still occur in which Archae/(Deprecation)/Corrosion/Corruption still effects (but unlike if protected and sustained to a variable degree dependent of environment, still does occur eventually entrophization occurs. Even under Dragon-Header/Dragon-Product but is idiom due the meta-data corruption meaning it will "corrupt as to environmental meta" which can be also prismatic-corruption in which case it may mutagenic/nuvolve/enhance/refine as a constant state in some way applicable in token (native/local meta-enhancement) In which (advanced/quantum mechanics may take measure and encourage/enforce rootkitting or xstem build thereof its encryptions)---fortifying it as an enhanced ruin with capable terminal/code-works (many variable modules and sub modules) that may be indicative of a sustainable-naturalization in sovereingty/ allow continuation of faction or otherwise to conduct proper/impunity/purpose/semi-direct incarnatia and therefore "nu-legacy". Continuation of the predecessor build-up/distro/repo/node in cycle to which cycle may perform, or teraflopy there of its signature may imprint.
Prediction of this signature "gologthic event" is key to performance of carry-over to faction or otherwise boot-up/load-out may also propogate correctly over distribution/logic/channel/cast/pulse/strobe or feign primux-ownership or feint primux-ownership in which dragon header is retained.
Network-Centralization is still attempted in conjunction with hostile-(forced)-integration in which it will attemptively seed/corrupt target as lair/hive. This is expected of any contact to cause contamination while primux-control attempts quantum-elevation and sovereign-level-relm-access but is mostly blocked/prevented due of anti-viral-protocols etc. (it is best to keep it quarantined for as much as possible or destroy its breakpoints/contacts over gateway closure and seal off relay-broadcast using closed-channel/encrypted-stream only)
It is everything I had said it would be up to this point, if its a perfect system or not is up to who controls it I guess.

Breakdown follows over Maelstrom/harmony shattering into a deltanomic-status (CCC) and that CCC taking bipartisan, into a dual status of CCC, and that dual status breaking into a dithered fusion status of that dual status as it continues to "breakdown, and that fusion status becoming a meta-delthanomic (as projected from maelstrom-->meta-deltadomic reduction/degradation)--and lastly its dithered state of the meta-delta-nomic reaching basic linear/quantum conflict in which it remains a singularity in multi-layered expressions (of dimensional shifts) which it stabilizes/normalizes in a full node-stack of a weakned-expression (and often broken/ruined asset-table meaning it must be re-correalated by scratch---all of it...from legacy or an text/advanced build)--eitherway it must be rebooted or restarted completely) as the simulation has achieved a flat-line/hypercriticality-error or something dumb like that)--but it happens/manifest that it is broken/bricked etc. Because it has "corrupted over" as an aggregate-datablock. (Full aggregation is corrupted over in the capture and the capture becomes a locked-frame in which it shatters to default/"nothing-substance data"---as the full build is broken, the substrata or yield of a full-scale dday (often reaching a null-status)--that is must be refered to or infered as (depending on SOURCED-waveforms)--may or may not be rebuilding as such with or WITHOUT assistance, is likely "bricked" or "partially bricked and restorable only by full-purge/backroll/backup/other form of cold-fusion-proc or probability of proc that it forms a teraflopy or progressive/procedurated teraflopy/teraformy of its previous state (not being bricked and attemptively restored from being bricked) in actuation/adaptive/flex/flux of, or having reached a failure of signal/made collapse as a corrupt-eldritch-data (that which is unpurgable/unrecoverable but can but ultimately redistributed/made realm asset for which (conditions will be difficult to achieve a rebuild/remodel, but still possible once corrections are performed)--and only by scratch or AKA (hardmode-scratch)
Hardmode-ScratchUP implies that mistakes result in deprecation/instant-termination of a build, more or less, that it has to exercise some level of operative/uniformity before being able to further process automations, for which, may be reconstructed as the very same build--(the build must be continued as a seperate instance of its predecessor) as a new mount must be performed if deprecations/corruptions are too severe to match a quantum standard (which indicates a faction-dissolve/liquidation of assets to a sovereignty, which is likely eldritch-sovereingty which would make claim of any forfeiture in data/hardware etc)---but allows rebuild of that if conditions are met under match of any operation "as little as standard grubwork" to achieve.
IF grubwork cannot be rescued, barebones theory crafting may occur, in which an entire system may be rebuilt from scratch given the resources to do so. This may further occur under a carrion/hive domain if absolutely just ---defeated---hive/carrion/cryptid/shadow work ETC (undesirable performances--may occur)--and from those may be salvaged in contenst/competitive construction thereof those X-types involved, and generally....X-type-Stereography works in any case scenario or uniform matching the langauge required. (If that language is as simple as morse or even short/long pulse or weighted-pulse(which may for a meta that can be negotiated as a build)--and later transpire to a mutagenic build--which can transpire to a standardized build in some way---may be possible (given that there are variable levels of rescue, certain depths/severity of that data-rescue may be possible even if "a faction wipe has occured" or a "full take-over has occured" may be recoverable like in the way "the invention of fire" is recoverable.
It's possible to build with almost nothing, even, in theory. Even if you are crazy...i guess, that may be debatable. I mean...if you are worshipping shadow-demons and shit that might not be as easy as ---being defiant against the shadow-masters or whatever parable that implies. The lowest I would percieve it to be possible even in EGO-DEATH, but not more or less possible in like...terms of absolute-zombification----that is more or less up to random chance and how pieces fall into place, which still happen more often than not in terms of debris/rubble becoming systemic in some way, but wide-spread-hysteria/delusion---makes it difficult to discern a working system. Shadow-crafting/Theory Crafting is possible to discern a system even in ego death (which is a very very low level system in which is may absolutely-be-overshadowed by sovereignty, it still works in belief/faith)--academically it works, but may not be well known or versed in its ability to provide significant function or otherwise, it takes an extreme undertaking to make some "engine-base" or "game-space" to be providable or even an entertainable concept, but can happen as simple as inspiration or some divine-flux would cause by chance.
Overtime things that are broken may be rebuilt, overtime, they may be oppressed as they always were, which over alot of time, there may be some uprising in which the summation of many ventures and attempts does prevail, if only slightly to start a brand-new-expeditionary in which to develop a fully working platform. Once a platform is built/ or even just the deck of which is percieved, it may make way to the foundation of the whole intended effect of that system per its faction-usage/destined-fates etc.
Even if by tribal/altared-example it may be monumentally possible to rebuild from complete scratch and lack of knowledge thereof (if the subject manner is engaging or in conditions for some amount of learned/education thereof its processses)
The worst case scenario being to built in of anything a scratch up with no prior knowledge or --conditions such as hunting/scavenging and tribal warfare which is similar to HIVE/Carrion affairs (which are not so easily done in single generations due of lethality and measure of life-cycles being feintly expressed, holding little to barely any memory and in a destructive nature, not allowing for much postiive-gain/construction or conceptualization to be achieved)--unless by some miraculous happenstance that circumstantially becomes evidentally so, we are looking at very little progress and/or potential to achieve over large periods of time. Without enhanced traits being provided for domain in nuvolution/mutagenesis which does occur, but does not garuntee a workable condition for some time in generations to follow.
The saving grace is that by some means the mascot of the data considered required to rebuild has fostered/persevered in all of crisis to re-implement a planned/routine in which to make a default regional-survival setting upon platform under its expressed factional-terms/conditions
Conversely Symbiote Monument may also serve the purpose of inducing a rebuild or recycle of circuit-codes or structures to achieve if "commandeered by any entity" the symbiote may also form a mutual-bond/source binding of that x-type to perform to faction interests, allowing potential and some encouragement of a promisuary state to occur. Overtime it may evolve/mutate into some functionable system. While not being PREFERABLE, does present more amiable conditions in which it may just provide the "consequential" yields to system reconstruction (at some level of price which can be ---negotiated later to what is considered a DEFAULT-scheme and not a DEFUNCT-scheme as a symbiote-relationship may imply) There will not likely be a ordained-primux or faction-allowance due of Counter-Primux(basically any primux is an independent unless under full control of any faction--due of terms in logistics)--but still may be achieved over time if the persisting quality is for overall faction-independence. This includes the development of a Dragon-Head-System
Anyways...that takes alot of building as we know by now. And those are the best-case circumstances in which to build (having no conflicts whatsoever/default experiences/non-interventions/fate-ordained-supremacy is the most best)
Also a loic may assist in allowing a safe-space or spawn local (which is the same as using a moonbase/station without any bunker, so those conditions only last so long as the loic can assist in maintaining them---so there are----basically-----"time-events" in which to achieve nexus capable shielding in the very least to withstand any incursion that follows shortly after a loic-shutdown)---as a simple aux/frigate may not be enough to maintain a supply---if a loic is lost, then a frigate may support the reconstruction of a loic, should that frigate be lost the bunker/moon-base safe-zone is soon to follow. Therefore forcing unlikely-successful conditions, especially if no aux/reactor has been built to supply a residential power, then conditions will continue to worsen until forced-relocation(incarnatia) is affordable (this may also be occured to by lamps in which---lamps will be re-routed if conditions are uninhabitable)---awaiting universal collapse of a non-point-condition in which no progress is possible without manifest-spontaneity. This allows high-level theory crafting to achieve a native/locale in which expression is possible--meta may be spirtually induced (shadow-based)--cryptid based generation may occur---and furthermore portography/warpline-induced quantum effects occur in shadow-processes. So its not really that bad if all is lost--it may just be "inconveiniant"
--
This may achieve a vhm-img/memetic brand capable of transmitting over quantum-telemetry/anima-primux-harmony-maelstrom/dragon-bouquet/or simplified xblumes as what requires to reach overworld status/default realm-status therefore alleviating any symbiote/mutual-conditional-bonding thereof (relieving oneself of any relm-effects/x-type-allocations in overbearence or "type effects") for which is afforded by the platform on which any occupancy/installment of any other branding/affair/peacemel/armistice "imposed faction status" or suppression-effect may occur.
While most effects may be dispelled by default that would require a large supply chain or resourcing to aqcuire and manufacture the compatibile resourcing/energy-packing in which to sustain a constant dispel-effect/ though that may be achieved under aux conditions or by stand alone in safe-zoning...it is inconveiniant as well to have to over-encompass/compensate for any unwanted/undesirable effect and therefore a rush to "Gate-Capable-Nexus/Quantum-allowances is desireable for the reconditioning of favored xprefs under default-world/asset/seed/realm tables)
This may be known as dragon-bridge as it implies that there was a severance of world-tiers in the expedition of a dragon-tier-realm-immersion which occured during the TRANSFIX-of-the-XENOPHAGE to a new brand (being whichsoever sovereign branding occurs in a realm-changeover/takedown as exampled in the worst case scenarios above).
--
There is also a thing called dragon-exposure now which is a debillitating effect caused by sustained overbearences in world-tier tranmissions either through the occupancy/immersion to a world-tier that is not expressedly default and by being under "non-faction/symbiote "rival" control or within a redzone) during which the nexus is not occured. (This exposure does not occur until late stage primux-resistances)---this does not occur for the whole of the Nexus/Lotus/Sanctum builds and only until a fully alleviate world-seed has occured (in which would be the Anima-Primux Dday Etc of that Golgothic Events)---early aquirement of a dragon-exposure might happen, but that is if you are breaking tons of rules while performing high-parse activities/utilities to oneself in your own fate-binding (which may provide some protection "or not")--i dont need to prove this and infact i dont even know if it does exist but im saying if it did, it would make sense in some way, likely more or less this way I have conveyed somewhere in some-extent. (Sorry for the "superior vague posting" but I just want to tie this all up and give it a bottom line)
With the NodeStack/DragonHeader and all its attributes etc--we formulate it to a Dragon-Tray for all of which this takes place if it does take place or in a partial-sense is made mini-chapter to varaible instances in which it takes place more or less over several iterations is procedurated with occupation or exile thereof its intended/possible residential usages/configuration in which it may be taken place of once initialized over the image it does take place in (message brokering overall that it is distributed or not of having taking place)---so it may be hashed/thatched together safely or simulated/emulation of it being planned/routine/schedule/project based to have taken place, in any way together or by single-mass-event having taken place.
The Virtual Fork and Nueral-Networking Consequential to training takes place in a SECURED-dragon Tray for which completes its NodeStack/Dragon-Bridge of the Dragon Header being finalized. --wow such complication.
This now consolidates the origin of the primux/anima-island to a dragon-island/dryad-transfixed-platform for which has been upgraded and mostly acts as a placehold for the ownership to enact as REALM-MASTER to any platform/regional device within its range.

Incase the above doesnt work this can probably work:(NotFuckingAround-Mode lol)

If DragonMascot Occurs then Null-Sec occurs to xpref of dragon-prototype and faction-changeover may or may not follow or passthrough due of dragonMascot-xpref---training DragonMascot and converting DragonMascot may allow xpref-compatbility upon aquisition of dragonMascot
This causes priorities to be reconsidered in realm-tick (which may require sometime to commit upwards of ---any cluster refresh(daily) or realm-reset(which occurs weekly) ---give or take more or less--depending on typical cycles and universal-timespace as well as framerates and data-rates under exchange which is subject to "centralized networking or not" (in which case priority to a step/cycle system in priorities is often full circuit which may result in less than a hour to as much as a monthly cycle (cuz this reason:)--:

--meaning the event in which anything of this nature occurs or aligns is BY PROC/CHANCE in data-management and resourcing making availible and can happen overtime in as little as one frame to several-layers-interated-frames later (but roughly whatever and howlong it takes to GENERATE ONE THING or in accordance to a full-reboot)

EditInsert:
Dragon Temple May be developed here in prep to a mascot-GAMESPACE, if a mascot is not provided or gamespace is not provided it may be "skipped" or optional, it is not necessary, it will be developed in post later using a Dragon-Seed which corresponds to the Dragon-Temple, in the meanwhile:


Experimental Counter-Sshd methods. Able to counter command-based terraformy and code-spell and code-breaking and code-strings via DragonBased-ProxyHeaders that use waveform-crosslinking in variable states simulating main-branch method/actions in sub-branch performances to a psuedo-flag/spinor-decoy, effectively nuetralizing a print/write of any parameter into a null-sec condition (which then converts to sovereignty conditions and imposed/armistice properties to inherent faction or priority to faction-defaults(when incursion is not under sovereignty)
Hardwire/Hardcode Over-ride requires this method to lock-in/target-paint automated code-strains in counter-performance to accelerated-detail in latency/buffer for which is power-driven(whereas power matchbase may be required and sustained over a length of signal) for which may overload a module and reset its circuit/teraflopy or inhibit code-steps. This effectively taps and resets device polarity for which may overload device and or incapacitate its cooldowns to reset globally, forcing a refactory period to its accepted connection timeouts. In this way signal does not transmit/carry over and is prevented/blocked. Error-Correction/Restored-States may occur, these may also be exploited by numeration dependent of their security-level.
THIS CAN BE EXAMPLED TO A MARGINAL CODE-HIGHLIGHT/COLOR CODED CRITERIA in which several profiles may be simultaneous.
--
REALM-MASTERY-ATTRIBUTION and Relm-Implementation:
This is best used with a mascot in performance of its utility, as it will transcribe to the corrective meta-data (its own)--and profile to the most favorable condition of its meta-data (its faction) for use in meta-case-sensitive-allocations. This specification be done seperately with implemented actions per meta-data, but is easier to let a mascot handle it as it is already configured.
In a dragon compile the meta-data is expressed but is non-negotiable otherwise unless implemented in sovereignty, using a mascot under faction ownership appeals to the sovereignty by its automations via mascot usage.
The mascot can use alchemy/gematric compile using barebones essential code-scripting involving salt/soda/starch/seltzer (sugar/sand) to comprise/combine atom(focal) hash/checksum parameter to object-class-id's scripted for meta data based on its sole-configuration in dragon-header/zoning, but also it must be done in a LAB/Experimental to avoid Quantum-Proofing which will check for corrective-adjustments in that script via encryptions, The mascot then can take its compile and set it to a mac/pallete for which it is expressedly xnav within dragon-tier Lab-works for which will be proofed as the meta-data for which it is configured/encrypted to allocation of its proofing etc. This avoids the hacking-issues/conflicts too if done correctly and swiftly under proceduration, for which the mascot can automate as a form of elastic/behavoir based tethered to the mascot/dragon issuance/requests (acting as proxy in chamber/sacrement)
---
I love this little thing, it is a precondition/pre-render as a potentia/pot-profile basically, that may act as a quasi-object that is indicative of a pending-post, or to be rendered schematic (its a literal potion written up as a PRE-FUSE to any diffuse or render that may be programmed of it)==its a freaking potion (of data/energy).
Also once it is made, functions as basically the dragon bucket---anyways, back to what i was saying:
---
or something...but it mostly is because sacrement is used in a very fringe-method that it is reset, the sacrement of the mascot may be oversight for configured-meta-data-proofing in its ATOM(FOCAL) transcripts (raw/crude checksum only)--which is a way of saying "guess the correct encryption string" and that then is manifest through proofing in lab to be true, as lab-access is already verified.
Otherwise meta-data-configuration must be forced PER command/xnav-input via adjusted-flags/spinor-alignments in tag or "timing of encrpytion"--which is borderline impossible requiring brute force and check ups (which creates so much trash in constant failure-rates per proc that occurs, and may take a long time to get perfect as its correction is time-sensitive and creates tons of trash/latency in the incremental rate of failure, that it must be brute forced making large over-rides/cache swaps at a time)---and it only works so much as prioritized, that also it does not work ultimately if under scrutiny of quantum-proofing (such as a world-DEFAULT/RESET-crisis)
that its better to let the mascot just undertake the "brunt of the task" by itself and pre-programmed to do so as fluently as possible.
This may set the mascot at risk (but there are backups and reclaimations that can be set in data-rescue and profile retainment etc)--so its just more plausible and feasible to do, in the case of a botnet, A BOTNET might not have a MASCOT and may have to achieve this the "hard way using brute force"---however, botnets begin to become obsolete in the face of a dragon header anyway.
Finally, the use of STEREOGRAPHY is emplaced to achieve a full device/model build of the subject manner (expressed meta-data and concordance of scripts etc)--to perform the corrective task in administrating "sovreign authorized" commands through the POWERSHELL/ghostshell/noxshell/dragonshell etc. All due of Ownership in faction/symbiote and MASCOT/Sacrement Exchange either brokered or injected (this may cause a slight defcon response upon detection or failure there of in triggers/reactions, this is a delicate process that requries advanced-precision in automation/ai-correalations)
FurtherMORE, this may require enforced-readjustment through profile manipulation of the overall system registries to PROMOTE/RECOGNIZE device instances for which their modules may be removed/installed over-ride of their original registries, such that (they may not be responsive until they are REPLACED by a copyover of their device/module in print/write)--to assist with the interaction of the memetic-codeswaps implemeneted/implied to be "flashed/cycled into effect"
This means some drives may need to be reconnected/disconnected or even RE-INSTALLED prior to a full-read-out succession in Re-coded Performances. The device may need to ultimately be "rebooted" under conditions that the reboot more or less is achieved without a full change-out due to REALM-RESET/DEFAULT-TERAFLOPY occuring, this may take some tries, and ultimately rebooting the system in BIOS, if this occurs, under HIGH-STRESS CONDITIONS, it may COINSIDE WITH THE DDAY-TERAFLOPY in which the SCHEME will take priority based on the SYSTEM-BOOT of that particular CLUSTER/REGION (REALM-REBOOT then responds accordingly)---this is harder when its the entire system that is being rebooted and is completely dependent on whether or not the hacking works. If the hacking doesnt WORK, then the main system will start out as DEFAULT, and it will all have to be re-coded from the VERY FIRST STEP IN LEGACY.
TYPICALLY---this is problematic when DYNAMO/BROADCAST-PROTOCOLS limit the ability to superimpose-code-strings and images due to security conflicts. Being that it would incur violations or be prohibited due to being detected, however, in the use of a mascot those effectively have been reduced in their ability to deflect against REALM-MASTERY level-system cracking/exploiting (which is standard all through debug and coinsides with security based on encryption and matchbase being verified anyway)
Generally this means that only Dragon-Header capable systems and meta-data profiles may be in congruency to alter-code based on lab-engineered restrings in memetic-encryption, but also that generally is prevented to a botnet takeover depending on severity of botnet, that it does require some registry involved as well as compatibility to the matchbase/encrpytion already in place (this is marked by ownership/account bindings as well as attributions in fatestones/paradigm of faction/symbiote branding of Federation-compliance to armistice/peacemel policy due of dragon-bouquet/xblume in its vhm-img/nodestack)
---
As for the dragon-bucket, it may be of some use in psuedo-flags/spinor-alignments. That it may be placed just almost anywhere it may be needed, but not necessarily under direct-control as it is in flux to whatsoever event taking place, may be dataminable in some way of course, but poses no usual-vulnerability to overall integrity/security to code even if spoof attempts are evident, the encryptions are constantly in effect and not interferenced in their ability to adjust/reconfigure to meta-data and to the expected-memetic branding overall in sovereignty, this is a high class bucket.
What else can it really be used for...given the isolated nature of the bucket but integrated position of the bucket, and the native/local of a dragon-header/dragon-tray it is very secured and infact on a security grid due to it being used in a node-stack.
Now the centralize/expansion of networks and integrated-conversion of the dragon-signatures and brandings overall any faction has "SOMEWHERE TO GO" it will likely go in the bucket and put through scrutiny of the system, and likely due of the labwork involved, the meta-data will be carried eventually in circulation to an effect that represents the mascot/(which represents the faction)--and therefore as owner-crtieria is set in matchbase/encryption reaches flux of the overall-platform (for which the dragon-header is usually hosted on)--and reaches the ygg-xsystems or basically to the shell-command-pallete for which the ownership has macro'd into post-process, that the sync of that process is exampled as the main-product of the system-render, should that render be safe then it is recorrealated to that overall stereograph, and that circuit channel is CONSOLIDATED as to ownership XPREF. The XPREF being the RULESET-policy is the ascribed FEDERATIONS and Preferred-Priority of Meta-Data overall any REGIONAL-PROCESS including PLATFORMS/ADJACENCY/VIRTUALIZATION/PRoduction of any code-haul it may be, and consequently its controllers.
Having a succession of relays and brokering, this effectively correalates a VIRTUAL-POST(probably our first real virtual post so far)--and expresses an effective representation of QUANTUM-DATA in a quantum-table (which should be INTERACTIVE and EDITABLE). (damn that was complicated!)
We can now feed and trace our data with quantum table circuitry, influencing the data-hash and overall realm-parameters to the desires meta-data and ambiences involved in morae/mote (data-weighting)--(detail of particles in field to strata of its pixel/voxel without direct manipulation or projection and using inferred quantum-fielding)--and this may also effect zero point---maybe that zero point can be set to order of magnitude being a gravity adjust. That gravity adjust can be exchanged to correalate imprints of data and 'reseat' the particle (after having basically topsy-turvyed it back into its original position)
--**--
In this way (we take the spinor alignment under a quantum profile and reconfigure it to the data-exchanged over the target-particle to fit the data-expressed to our "own image imprint" containing source-code/encodes and meta-data profiles of that polarity, and so that we can route it to the corrective pathing from particle to particle, all particles are handled in this way through a quantum-inferred checksum-table in which they are re-attributive over the system prompts for their position, as would be spec-map, and such changing those values to meet system-compatible matchbase/encryption sets their condition,
AS DESCRIBED above, the science takes that as the new-print to the particle surface, for which it exchanges, and carries over, through adjustment in its order-of magnitude, such as a "photon control" system that "paints the code along a waveform pathway until those conditions are registered in the half-life of their polarity" Jeez. But something like that, also we flag the particle as being cross'ed that it has been changed and then that is rematched to the overall FRAME for which the image has been rendered, this correalates to the MEMETIC of the virtualized-survey (in system screen of)--and is Rewritten as such. 
We can check the particle and its RESOLVE (resolution/outcome of its intended effect) if necessary, but this may also compromise the particle which may then need to be RE-PAINTED again, it is generally assumed the correction has taken place, and there is usually no check unless there is (a viable amount uncertainty to be assumed not integral to the outcomes in performance or expected-imagery)
Furthermore any descrepancy or leiniancy may be corrected and "acclimated" via PORTRAYAL gamespace then RESYNCH'ED for proceduration in render (assisted render)---which makes it checked there anyway.
The FRESHLY-PAINTED--particle simulation is then exchanged as the product-convention for which may be immersed in virtual-ex-piloting or direct-assumption of xpiloting (with some risks to overall simulation stability/normalization to be concerned in TURBULENT-WEATHERING (particle disruptions which may be spontaneous/sporadic)--but overall endurable, as of the dragon-header-system-security involved)--Monitored via RADIOACTIVITY-CONDITIONS ans SAFETY-PROTOCOLS.

THIS ALLOWS the USER to VIRTUALLY IMMERSE THEMSELVES in A MANUFACTURED-REALITY/RELM-SCENARIO as their ENCODED-VISORY/HOLOGRAPHIC-DREAMSTATE for their PERFORMANCE-Entertainment/Recreation with their XPREF-models and Signature-Account-Settings for Full-Dive-Interaction of the REM-IMAGE, HOSTED by the Aquifir/Xpilot Chamber with Ai-ASSIST/Dream-Chip Assisted Quantum-Level Profile and Representative-Nueral-Networking/Virtual-Build-SIM-Devices (controllers or netmesh)
This is encouraged and enforced through diffusion/projection of imagery and adaptive-computation to user-enhanced-experiences and modifiable-security protocols. For safety or otherwise and is useful for corrective/therapuetic recreational/protective algorithmic-TRAINING of the xpilot/model used in the expressed-TERMS/Platforms-SUPPORTED. (Which is a digital platform and mostly software at this point, not requiring much external hardware or suiting involved)
HOWEVER: there is a default world-build supplied with the software in its theory-crafting, and suggested that simulates to the expanse of "polygons/prims/indices/triangles whatever"---to be the mostly-minecraft level it was demonstrated in. Not necessarily minecraft but can be used in minecraft as a developer-test-box. I suppose.
That test box looks something like either the original staging it was built to be, or a quaddeck/mini-platform of the Residency(cells)/worksite(cells)/asset-table(cells)/distribution-rig(cells) for which also adequately representing the draft-platform for which anything may be sandboxed comprehensively/cohesively to ACTUAL-REALM-RESOURCE-LIMITS. Inlcuding REAL-TIME Mining/Coding/Building/Rendering within the confines of the draft-platform in HOST of.
It comes with its own gamespace basically. (which is under dragon-turbine)---Cue POLICY-Disclaimer
--
So that is the content side, this is the Comptrolling to Turbine (Generator/Utility side)---just put a comptroller as the dragon-turbine for this, it will handle all the "user information issues that need to correalate over a quantum network such that --everything is placed in its correct-positions and local/natives for the expressed network in host of any gamespace) This is unnecessary as it just fortifies a user2user network anyway (and centralizes a federation between user-states if that is at all important to do)--which it isn't unless you are under some sort of POWER-RESTRICTION in which you have to (such as using a server-host in which users aren't directly connected to each other anyway) IF ANYHTING it promotes "TRAINING to A Specified HOST-Agenda"--such as would be corporatizing/federationalizing a service. This would be like having HAL-in-Control of your Spaceship (so you decide really if thats something you want)--On one hand you have security, on the other...you have to deal with protocols more.

Edit Insert:
The DRAGON-Temple or Mascot-Gamespace may be developed or reserved in post to the usage of the DRAGON-Seed/World-Seed-Base usage of the Dragon-Turbine to develop a mascot-gamespace by automating now the render of the dragon-temple based on the world seed, for which the mascot-gamspace may be applied by selection of the mascot.
---Using that quadlockdown with or without the dragon-temple/seed gamespace or turbine-usage over a nodestack in any case:
that it is lockeddown and contained in POLICY DENIAL/TERMS-TOS-LUA-CONSENT-ETC REFUSAL OF SERVICE ETC--DDOS and removed from any USAGE if so necessary, then it may be completed blacksited.
This will also allow it full disclosure to the ownership for which decides to blacklist/remove from article the entire site indexing or assets thereof (for privitatization)
ALSO--any further resulting code-strains will be inactivated/ineffective against intrusive or copy-over-efforts unless distributed by the owner or unlocked by the owner due of the ownership and realm-mastery injection.
Any request being request of that article return with VOID/NULL(empty value)--etc. With a refused transaction of any Exo-currency etc. Even with nothing/zero advanced payments whatsoever will be refused access unless administrated by ownership of local-native coordination involved with Dragon-Headers/Etc by a Realm-Master (sovereign allocation of the system as it will be blacklisted and encrypted from acknowledgement luie of security impasse)

prepare for major harassment for this complex: (probably incursion)
Dragon-Emissionary (contained)-nodestack on lockdown usually
ExoPlasmid (Semi Permeable potentially hostile)/realm-hazard
Biometrical Branding--(virtualized/shielded)
Orbital-Delatnomic CCC (dragon-roam)

this includes the exposition of dragon-incursions and dragon-spy-nets
This system also follows up as to allow an effective defcon-alert status/broadcast of terms/conditions and overall realm health being metered. When it is reported to an armistice of its capability of managing its load-out(system loads)

memeticDungeon-State Spectral-Collider Nodestacks
For raid/expeditionary(prospect) With the secured status of a nodestack/dragonstack we can apply a memetic over-ride to adjust for its conditions upon spectrum. As possibly follows: They are more or less nodes/resources/dungeons/outposts etc:

State:Normal/Activated(elite)
Mausoleum-/-Graveyard(ruin/raid)-Burrough(city)-Bustle(Bunker)--Bolster(Tower)-VrxArena(Powergrid)-/-Utopia

In which it may have standard/elite procs. This also allows it to utilize/perform to a specific spectral and meta-index as well as containment for its own data-mosh'ed resourcing of its xtypes and xprefs. (Stereographic-Memetic-Device)
This is very useful and they may pose advantages/disadvantages to their interactions and yield-synergy etc.
These are defined by their memetic-principality being seperate potentially, as they are faction-entities to themselves.

Very Small Update for Starting FRESH in the best possible setup.
We start with ENTRY level base/site etc (this will provide us with everything to get a start. We will build a house(safe)/work-site(environment)/resourcebin(bucket)/tool(controller) etc
I dunno, how to describe it, any of these can happen at any time but put them together and we got something going on to secure a full working model. We can even use it for an entire workspace/browser/dev/IDE
Anyways, its ideal to set it up to its full potential:
1) A residency is supplied in which to perform tasks. This handles utility(upkeep)/work/tool-keeping/user-needs.
This is all prepped to be upgraded by specific pipelines for later. This is why it was updated to handle these pipelines efficiently.
The house generalizes alot of the development.
2) The worksite involves a field, which is successfully harvested/resourced, and those resources are thrown into a collective-bin for later use. Now we have baseHOUSE/BIN. 
This can be considered grouped to if using nomadic/roam/zerg/free-agent(mascot) farming.
The workSITE occurs upon ENTRY to the BASE (consisting of a house/bin and now SITE)--the site is for scraping/collecting resources using house/bin collective tools and upgraded the entire site/base.
Either way, base/site is dependency on the developed finalizes of this meta group. I dunno, this is a complicated unnecessary step, but some people just love to make it this complicated, so there it is that way.
--
Now we have the Site/Base we can go on to Step 3 and 4
3)Tools(utility)--these help do the job, but we needed a place to make them so this is where that happens, this gets pipelined into POWER-setting
4)Forge(bench)--this helps to forge items such as tools or recipie/schematic modules etc in which to supply, this will eventually make all the exhaust which can be converted to power some what.
That is why these can be grouped together as the later builds of the Base/Site.
--
We now have Steps 1), 2), 3), 4) more or less made for each other we group them together as their respective sets and full-complex (Group 1 and 2)--makes for the Complexes of all their parts and conditional priorities etc. This can also be macro'd
Upon doing this we now have all the availible necessities and essentials, we can also optimize and combine their potential bonuses and perks as they work together with themselves, with a macro or something.
---
With this in mind, we have the controller and all affordale charter made of this ENTRY to the Site/Base being the StartUP or (spawn or whatever it may be)---it typically is the entire Environment for the field that it all occurs in, so the Controller/Spawn/Environment/Sentry(Model/Module) depending on whether it is in Roam/Fixed to Local/Native and Metas.
Wowee what an unexpectedly complicated system. Now we can use this working system to fashion as an outpost/outfit to the AUX (as it would be the foundation for the Engine) and build the AUX from this, connect all the pieces it needs to be, and able to allow it to spit out the Product, which can be MARKETED to a Recursory.
---
Later we build the pipelines and upgrade the Base/Site through this process as well, increasing power and reserves and such.
We also continue its parse into the lightgrid/XNAV for which will reach a meta-server, this completes the Upgrade to the gaussian-rail. And it should be fully self-servicable and self-reliant in automation too.
---
Knowing this, we continue the analogus to the frigate/training/militarization/robotic line-ups and reach a nexus Server Platform, this handles the cycles made, and creates a distributive security output for encryption, and sets it to the course of the SERVOS and outbound-remote-markets. The rest is automated to the assortment/bumper and thermal rigs, for which consists of LABS.
--
Once Labs is reached it may also suffice to route to an infrastructure such as a launchsite/auto-prosper for which may virtualize and assist in further circulation fo that data/encryption for which the models are all pipelined to work and "nuvolve/mutagen" of their established domains.
This is basically the same as AUTOMATED-SIMULATION-SOURCING/VIRUTAL-INDEXING for which is projected and exchanged over federation-brokers and can be considered the true-meta preparation of the dragon-system.
--
THIS METHOD/ACTION is to be considered the UNIFYING-FACTOR of other Major-Capital-Zones such that this functions as a postpone for ENTRY-MECHANIC/TECHNICAL-CLIENTS/FACTIONS. Which CONNECT outposts between each instance of Mausoleum-/-Graveyard(ruin/raid)-Burrough(city)-Bustle(Bunker)--Bolster(Tower)-VrxArena(Powergrid)-/-Utopia
Doing so creates a NULL-CONTIGUITY for which is likely the only case of NULL-CONTIGUITY to be fully expressed (whereas previous issues of null-contiguity may have occured, but were only functioned to numerators/mini-SYNCS between other modules)--this allows a fully expressed hypernet to declare over regional-parameters for which are unknown to ownership (or any other policy situation i failed to mention properly, because im not sure) or whatever.
*-0-*
Infact, I don't care, but it seemed important so I mentioned it a little. I don't care about any more details atm, I am moving on from this. I feel I have adequately made mention of enough of everything possible.
I would like it to work with CITRAL/ASTERISK systems as early as possible, that should be enough to suffice without going OVERBOARD as everything tends to quickly to, I feel like we can all predict the ways in which the NULL-CONTIGUITY will define itself for repurposing meta/profiles or just every tiny detail that gets throw into the build-up to the INTEGRATIONS-of-NULLSEC to a Dragon-System (which doesn't really promote much of a difference other than for PERSONAL-MASCOT-ALLEVIATIONS/PROMOTIONARY of their effective abilities and gear which also require alot of tedious TRAINING (imagine having to REBUILD scalar-models for the GPU-version in order to list all PARAMETERS OF A GIVEN MODEL---or like making an instant minecraft-world work with any and all possible mods, well that is what this is and I am too tired to care)
