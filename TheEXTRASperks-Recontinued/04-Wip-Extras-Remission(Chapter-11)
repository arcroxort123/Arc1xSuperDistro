04-Wip-Extras-Remission(Chapter-11) ---FollowUps-StreamLining
11/15/2021
probably gonna take me 4-5 hours to finish the "pop-diffuser" (a two story with 2 wall sections per wall simulating a sublevel quasi-platform and top level quasi platform with a partisan split of the whole building in half
if i rushedit and im not rushing in fact i already used an hour so im taking a break
using the gnell flysuit and still can finish my job on that ip
--
this uses strip strapping techniques
scp they are being insubordinate and raiding me
they basically tried to hit all of the buildings at once so you know...its just going on the blackboard with the rest of strategies they did
--
we will then use strap and stripping to fill in the rest of the spce once the building is done
this will allow us to multistrand with our quos
the red panel was shoveled lol
by our own base production

really the first instance the shovel worked itno a panel that well (it has before but badly)
mostly its just my own guts and drive pulling the panel power together
this will optimize the auto turret by mem stat and momentx timing then counter with iso-voids
the iso voids are orbital quos that are in hostile state
this will help to allow our void-gneldrake
which will compensate up to 63% of our base line
--
--harassment again
building a guardian robot for this over the Ops-sc psy-department building 
dual cannon imp guardian/jetpack charging stinger-plugin tail lol
mass produce 2k
(feeding the war machine so to speak)
makes void powder out of everything (will sustain our Co-wahparate(Protocol) level gnaelsuit)
"this is over mc dc trying to raid my shit and then getting mad and blacklisting diplomatics when caught"
so you know...nuclear-protocol and such (stupid crap i go thru with spies)
1963 total defense weapons projected
---

void dust for strip and strap for our strand sustain
IF we are currently at war-alerts we are going to exercise war protocols and conven with full roam
--
our roam surround is enacted to dispatch and we will full roam against occupational forces (counterops against invasions..we will not necessarily retaliate or counter invade, trying to avoid problems)
but the war effort is basically forced declaration of th raiders pillaging us for intel and resources (its borderline criminal how much they attack, how much i tolerate, and how much i dont do anything about it)

--back to building
this can also mana a skitch transport (literally a moving platform)
converting to a weaponized siege engine (EMP-BASIN)
basically a diamond back but minecraftian style (almost couldnt avoid this)---it was almost quantum-candlestick level--it was prevented then, but we did not have quantum candle stick tech mastered until (atm it was 11-2021) late 2023
using an autovoid from the building
to sustain its autoflux
as its in constant hypersonic states
the hypersonic beacon cannon can be power-dosed to prevent it reaching critical mass (or skirted with dimensional ranching or something desperate)
hardening dust in the auto void
otherwise its a doomsday capable blast (but it may not be but it may just destroy the quo)
from behind held or even the machine itself
uses dual Electro-Talons as well 12
--
fnished with the lower half and top half now need to roof
what i should have to do now is seal the glass cieling
(tax breaks in larry land lmfao ---im just having an maniacle episode and trying to make it seem normal, im very stressed and traumatized tbh)
--
the mill is hardened with the crumbs (there is  rare drug making alegories) and then is finalized
then use bathsalts on them (or dowse with grit to supercharge whatevr)
so the mill+med to the dust throw then gets glossed with the salts (so its full grade) mass x
--
finished with that building

now to use the system as if it deals with skinwalkers aka a space-tial aliens
just like irl crypto-philes
i think we mentioned multigrains somewhere lets say they are optimized now
performing system area checks for adequate function
our wahaparate hits the dragon level with crisp gear resistance (prime exemplary)
site compelx has 7345.6 out of 10k limit (of population count---those include cadavers or disembodied inmates--not to alarm anyone tho)
70% optimiability of default productivity
coupled with sea usage
function of site connected to wahparate status
3456 total fluctuations on detected list index
1256 fluctuations at beacon site towards isle
site detail at 30% encumbered state (still productive)
market at 70% availibility average
16% hospitaibility usage
70% work load
hi occupational work load and assigned forge registers (outbreaks of 1.5k)
repository of 85% total
5.5 out of 10 level clearence adaptionability
7.5654 full extensiability (stress)
3.456 functionability of printer to model production
Counting everything up atm:

---
this will wrap up and clamp together if built correctly
or trifold with a top and bottom lane over the mid core (non dynamic-delta but also is multi-layered)
and make up the most of the frontside engine (can be fit with turbo axels afterwards for use)
we can call the icbm(nuke) a turboaxcel frame if its deweaponized (we have this because of sub/frigate usage and development with behemoths and just the level of science involved with fabrications) (it is used for fulton/carepackaging and colonization and "cryptohijacking"--not necessarily a nuke)
and then the turbo axel correalates the wheels (which are now jet engine centrifuges)
that can also be quad pieced for turbo jett modules
or fit as a mainpiece over a single quad plate (for the whole engine to hover)
then the pilot housing can be used on top of the engine frameworks
for antipodal deployment as a capsule can be ejected from a mainship
with or without landing struts
known as parachute scones
it usually is landed on its own recepeter that is placed prior to launch as a waypoint
and the capsule can also escort its own cargo by applicated tote
so it can trasnfer totes automatically as well between sites
using gpsec adaptions
which likey can also be rendered with quad pads or helipads
for use as a capsule pack (for mech piloting)
it is versatile but not combat worthy
mainly for relocating residualities in case of full region shutdown
and to recolonize its own areas up to the required robotics
in order to correalate its first recursory
then from there it must reconstruct to its secondary recursory
which is way later tdown the rail at the end of vrk launch
--
the first meta server after the research and nav line is considered t-capped
then the carrier produces its quadshelf for the echo signal (aixilliary carrier systems)
then we can start complicit policy for factorization of the logistics
raid systems come into play to the bridge factories and logistics with business and logistics
with raid complexities (this deals with outbreaks and domestics issues with auto-security task)
or the "business side of security"
we can then assure our memorial respects are paid with the clerical edificiaries T-2 Caps
this occurs in zshield with sepluchers and straight up (mortuary work) linked to facility works
this is due to doctoring and forensics required
this also allows for ancient biotech weapons such as the viral kernal piece or turnstones
--11/18/2021
which are elementiumalized for our own purposing in resources
power rails and exo-chaining is necessary for the sustained demands of an expanding region
as well as redux complianceswhich account for overall T2-work capacity and carrying capacity
and of course our flight rail is ESSENTIAL at this point
and helps to autonav to scripted traffic systems that are constantly in motion
which is one of my childhood aspirations, why i wanted to be a traffic controller for airflights (and obviously just didnt cuz im a mess)
so basically a second prosper line is desireable
or a 'row dual line'
or basically a launch site dedicated for the second prosper demands
which definitely allow our reasoned use for queueing the snare
i can dual rail and fit two expos on here which is better than planned but i dont want to do it
entropy station with the squeedge-pro
a rail rifting ship can also fit a squeedgepro
with the excluster
at the arcade:CURFEW AT DARK NO EXCEPTIONS, SO YOU GOT IT AND EVERYONE GOTS IT MAKE SURE U KNO
Activate or DEACTIVATE Security Guns if otherwise (outside rail protection from launch--not internal guns ofc)--curfew does not apply there
long nose dog most of the square (a building technique as to how im going about putting blocks together)
--
i commission for the removal/revoc of privilege of several incompoentents burdening this system at an insufferably cost and for whatever reason else (being spies or potential spy removal)
--
*connections are getting compromised to viral outbreaks (probably due to spies)--harassment
---11/22/2021
this is the driver platform of course for the retaker which is a code chokehold
and helps to recentralize barrel production
which acts as a barrel turnstone for barrel obelisks
the barrel obelisks secure the vamping of the region
from xrealm dimension vmaping (it happens)

--building through some harassment (it was awful)
not my problem (mission persists despite multiple abortion attempts) and attacks brought on by rivals
---it was bad and lasted awhile of the day

11-26-2021
the minuature cavern yadormech are also infused with doctorate utility (not to mention  cyto)
which they use meta-quos in order to sustain themselves during surrogation of mech transfer
using vulkan 3 stage cognition
within their glass-cahbmered exo frames (that house the quos) and conduct the utility + tesla
this creates an indepedent life form based off mech surrogation
and it is helpful to contain with 4-5 layers (the fifth powering the entire rail that serves them)
so its prosper rail can reach promiscuity end game
but requires all these pieces in order to also be capable of sustaining once fed via population
because the relm resources will hit a universla timesahre that incurs remote trades between
this power block fits with the new model for promiscuity
being next to a spawn setter is optimum for its capacity
which is next to launch optimizes the procs

---
building the comptrolling board (or arrivals/departures bulletine-board)
literal starun/saturn manifests
they are using the bouquet power now
start/launch/assembly -colonize capitalize (resecure_ 1.2.3.//4.5.
this is similar to a 4th ram rail (the third being a warp drive the second being the complex)
the first being the ..printline i guess or when or where any 4 rails systems come together
the ram sets are considered optional to any other rail tangent
so basically power (or printset) complex set //warpset and this set here///clusterset
then they meet up with video driver sets (which are large regionals)
for insatnce the power thermal set is a more video-card-set than a ram-set
and the issues with the carrier set might be considered video card (with nav) or the nukeline
point being that something somewhere accounts for the ram and video card usages
--1-2 complete working on the 3 platform
this will then color code correctly using synth pixels
silver lining after this basically
for mutagenics
--3rd done

the synth/pixel board will work in adhocs
even tho i deja vu alot
--11/27/2021
this more of a relm state save panel in prior models
the thermal rig needs a control band so does the warp dive and they are wired differently
so then of course the printer has control band (tho its lesser used than the mainlines)
the new synth train (i guess) needs its own control so thats like 4 ramsets and get bands
and gpu board hubs for whichever thing they are for 2x get their own *(dual bands)
so basically lets just say the whole railsets get their own bands assigned via color codings
which there are like 25 or so total bands to encode
some are complex some are just basic logistics bands
this forms a control macro if anything im guessing to ease of access and remote assignments
but the snakre --> market produce --> manufacturing of goods --> to nectar base (is some meta)
in which full meta-quo packs can be distrubted to the logistics settings
these are shipped to the sotrage reserves based on broadcasts
1234 5 6
they are of course correlated to their use and destinations
this is generally as fuel for automine and autofarming (which supply the same chain) to gyro
gyro pickup goes direct to sat beacon and is used for print based on vocationary rebound
this helps to coordinate the thermal rig and security sector
which manages data uptake to the circuit board and system
and basically allows co operatives to function under a power region

building extra stuff at the meta-convention

the colony performance occurs from the engine gspec triauxx and the haxstax engine
or basically full triaux plus stax tote
this is deterred with emp but only by regional limit
allows for quantum state extraction to occur between metaquos
which can count as a vbios-sacrement under proper encoding

this allows for hyperbeacon wards
and ward mechs for meta deploys
which assist in scp takedowns
so we can emp dose and element cheese quos (specifically now meta quos)--remote registery attack (dwording)
so that can retain during x-quo usage
and remain optimized throhgout transit (which is a nontypical issue
it correaltes with being and holding faction branding and control use throughout application
either are breached they are free stadning quos (they wont breach unless attempted now
a free standing quo will likwly be absorbed by the environment or relm and alter signature of
it is noted when and where free range quos occur to prevent warez and other digi-attacks
the spiritual models that colonize guardias also can utilize free range quos if acquired of
this is a preventitive measure ot stop our assets from being exploited and does not interefere
it does not make alleviations or secure any work practice or grant any favors outside count
--
we still remain under protocol due to the limitations and excess of the power loads
does not displace or enable any other extra process other than protecting acquired quos
mutagenic release is also a concern fo rquo capture if quos are bein enhanced by traits
will make mutagenic quos protect themselves from being acquired (or claimed if leaked over)
basically doesnt matter as mutagenic quos are still capturable and do not (usually adapt)
outside region specificities *the mutagenic quo remains up for grabs by most targets allowed
natural mutagenic quos are not picked up by synth register unless synth register instructs
*registry categorizes all quos and their uses and spawn and procs and count within region
and attempts to correalate to recurosry prime and recurosory main
this relay is known as quo relay that is put through its own control bands (over broadcasts)
this augments to the conveyed network channel rss feeds and their index condition monitors
allowing vbios through vrk (which is heavily implied and buffered to current status reports)
this protects from infiltrative echo-warez or any other form of data injection
due to singularity within computational quantum states (while quantum state is in mode of use)
evo mode is a power mode that increases load and security while eco is a power saver mode
and the process of deciding that is automated through power loads and reserves or demand
this creates overspell and darkposting (which are posts that are bad or off protocol)
this creates universal morsela (which si filled with syingular cyto-fluid based elementium) 4/23/2024 a co-engineered native/local bugpack of rawdata
which ocurs over control boards as a meta-quo ingot
it can absolve power regions via energizing its power boards entirely (over-shielding)
the shields basically on a free charge based on the spur-quo that is usually takes form of
basically acts as a cpu unlock (for the region only)--(allows a runtime capability/usage)
and condenses to a burrowed-supply shed
that acts as an undistributed undisturbed x-cavern or mauseleom
and collects any build up of starcrumb to any other material naturally from leftover source
the use a optimacro to handle the power spawn relay of the region
which acts as a (big barel system)
big barrel system is also on an rss feed and its stats are monitored (using cyto-encoders)----4/23/2024 (monitored in case of bugpack/ballistix consumption too)
these are usually delegated via pilgrim colonies with or without guardians as to workspace
and set to a cyto-type for the xregister
also based on turnstones or keyspotting with items (keypass)
there allows for meta gematrics to allow for summoning palletes of base hyper-cyto quos 4/23/2024(or standalone support panels/floating tensor that remains unused and cnanot be used while in summon or suport states, acting as only a test) until it is delivered or made commute to its desintation for use THERE. (they are suspended animation bascially)
they are released from cyto prisons in their xrelms and used as attack minions 4/23/2024 (or designated panels or plate-zones) --- based on their designated signature and entry/routed tracjectory pathing ---(they can not be used until they are off bulletine...ALL BEULLTINE OBJECTS ARE BASICALLY ON PENDING QUEUE)
based off starcrumb and bloodplague reserves for minera packing 
host variety of traits including ray tracing congruencies where they just seek the target
they can also allow for prism core reconversion if attacking central circuit
known as emp cheesing they force upgrades to bluehaven states and force quantum usages
this terminates most utility over time incapacitating entire network
within universal timeshares shuts and locks out to expansion and other raid forms

4th built

--4/23/2024 holy shit i feel so marooned...i feel so bad for no reason...hubris and lonesomeness...not even want to 'kms'---its worse feeling than that just so tired and exhausted with no end in sight (might i crashed my serotonin or something?)--i dont want to think..feels like deadcrow but not even knowing helps
--
silver lining minion spawns that are netmeshed against most region controls designed for tkd
they are resistant to outside command other than from their portal master
this includes any warranting or cease orders or general divesionary pamphleting or cleric
are mext set to a flag ship (command station) which uses them as a source calling (guard)
source portal is also turnkey and secured via crypto loding (inset with extra protection)
this will bet the source portal which sets on the ram driver
they are already sustained by the treatment planting of meta quos (and hyper packing)
they use their level 18 ship to convert to a hypnos capable ship setting
via meta quo acceleration
making it the only excuse i have to ever use purpur blocks (and its pretty bad excuse)
i dont need to use them but the point is this makes sense here to use them but i wont
basically the flagship is a carrier and has full interceptors that use these little meta-models
the carrier does use tripodal placement (because it barely has the resources for full ship)
but i can of course make it a full ship with this platform if necessary
this was a big issue that starcraft didnt really tackle
--
the flag ship then documents itself as a soruce encoder from the xregister
bamboozling batch lines into sharp encodes (which are advacned encodes that are singular)
or basically an nft encode
allows for gspec autopiloting control with nft controller guidance systems

crumb-->graham-->crisp-->optiplex
all turn to minera-pack (or bloodplague impurities)
eventually allowing for a minera pulse node (hyperquo)
these work in x-bubls are trasnfer from rails to bridge sets allowing based contorl outputs
and can convert hardtop-barebones to full prism core capability within adhoc range
though their computable FPS rates may be limited by hardware
are sharpened via advanced encoding of singularity (the lower qulaity the rig=less duration)
i have major thumb joint pani also signalling heavy impulse that (i interpret as channeled rate)---im so bored but also i need to type this out so im making as much detail known to the ordeal as possible
it effects prim usage
this means im doing something right i guess (getting weird inpsirations from body pangs)
this may signal for advanced consecrations of portal fields
which ties into paladin units and templar
perhaps even archon or (as we term them atronachs) that are summoned thru portals
can adhoc full platoons (ground units at whim)
which is a step above the usual (independent portal capbility) they can handle group portals
and advisably use floating mechanics for full ship class module sets
as they can and also often lockdown full townships (including colony based epets)
which calls for portal bridge control (setting the relay from 1234 5 67 to 8)
by way of advanced gematria
which is basically masonic gematria
is also done through standard wizardry mechanics (run through templates on encodelines)
when overspell is in effect is can be primsourced via a prism in order to fufill its workorder (4/23/2024 or placeheld by a GRIT)
this cases a radian or consecrrated saturate table which is normally a thickmilky-blue (unprocessed)
or pearlescent block housing such as in synth blocks or whole blocks
whole block is basically converted to a synthestone (which can be now adjusted in wholesume)
is allows for muta-genotyping which considered stage 6 relm-building (using collective nft)
the use of which is extremely filtered and secured via other measures within the circuit-table
but can deploy full batallions and base structures to any locaiton prior to construction
basically an auto-drafting mechanic where the registry performs the rolechecks avialible
using raw resourcing or even raw encoding
basically terraforms the area and ports a full base in preparation for occupation of area
known as the jackolantern effect
the area is precurosr to a rendered edition of the system projection (strawman-->assembly)
--
or from otherwise radioactive source ---> decontamination methodology
then the event draft is rendered such as part a ---part b (draft and placement)
--strong hallucination of r2d2 as my cokecane wowie..my brain is melting and glazing over so numb of typing this junk--but the visual was so real i could see all the micro-details
--part c is activation or basically stage 5 and stage 6 is phasing upon the board and re-calc
stage c is basicalyl activation and registry components for area-scanning
the meta quos are fed through the abjunction (joisting portal) and it is assembled by design
advanced graphics assembly
tiger underfooting
quad controls are issued by the powermac to the-exbulb in a quantum state of advanced gpu-x
it is referred to as flag-sourcing (where flags are drawn over multiple layers to a source)
and is used with flag ships that are in port of their multisource
therefore creating a multiflag or sourceMAC
the source mac is its own control for all the ramsets and gpuIDS
to correalate a flag zone
flag zone has its own source and control and captains station (pref with whole/synth power)
and its considered a vrk residuality
--
then an nft is basically ported on top of the region model to solidify its faction -assets cpu
basically as a ProcMAC
it is of course failsafed and proofed ---4/23/2024 and determinate against other FALSIFICATIONS that ARE CONSTATNTLY being SUBMITTED AGAINST CHECKS (it checks against these too)
as a patchworkable batch order
under a heavy buffer of gpu and cpu strains (it checks the bugpack going on too if the option is selected to do so)
therefore making it a faction flagship capable flagzone
--
it centralizes the isometric chip placement to the socket of the proc station (or cpu thread)
---DONE WITH THAT (5th)
--start filling in their color coded adapater-borders
---
the flag ship can nuetralize and take down other portals and class batallions on its own auto
through portalMAC
silver lining + nuance makes for the cytogeno types
which can be infused with elementium
lapis infusion
---more or less done with the bulletin and all its connectors and color codes

--
its raining everywhere (we made god cry i guess)
11.27.2021 portalramset makes for like 30 additions (now at 130 total)
the genotypes are color coded (as per interests of the genotype of the elementium they are
then we can use a genomac obviously to assort all the exchange of the vrk module residents
with genomac we can assign a Insurability standard to prevent exploitation (or accounted)
so for that a primMAC
it will work as an assistant guiding template for the overlays of the chorelist (taskmanager)
and will work to paying off whatever excess was unafforded
so a  task(MAC)
that works more like a quest journal
and unlocks rewards or benefits (or discounts avialibities)
that way it can be set to a clerical file for library/record/archive/accountkeeping xcleric
xcleric handles that and uses the resulting MeltMAC to assign traits to any outlying morse
morse nodes and notes are identified and therefeore flagged and tagged under a guilld tabel
---Unrelated 4/23/2024 my REALM NEED DATE-BREAD products
this is then handled with off-lodged banking (and locking warranted vaults for account own)
it can breakdown a 7.51msq powerload to a .63 (if not further reduced to an evened balance
under succinct and (non illicit) contracting reeemary
by which is also tagged and anchored during the quest haul of the propsed (prposed) tray fufilled
upon fufillment reaches full-apdi status if in balance and solves the 'mystery' of the power
or casues a structure melt with the account being absolved in its clearence not exchange
payment/foreiture
in which the quest must be re-assigned or ticketed for the prompt usage and reward of work
as to a quest being used for work-contracting under quest logs are (not so detailed as in)
the entirity of this is autoMAC'd to the xcleric office presiding of the guild installed quests
this results in 7.51msvq (power) being paid in full per then the rewards of the following quest
by that it clears the power demand and enbalbes the rewards (if any) to be redeemed condition
this isk nown as the meltdown process for (resupplicating the powerload ofquesting resident)
such as making asset allocated data or quos or object or flagged module or any other use
"use is registered and correalated and then shelved" as is processed by the full system
---
also referred to as a QUESTMAC
--
or to the effect later pronounced as GuildMac (which defines its quest missions)
also known as the site controller - Mac if indicated in the VRK (handles all the onsite allocation
so the past 4 or 5 macs make their own control order
theres no cheat around to this not even in official diplomacies its either perform as is or not
even in damages or reparitive methods are not garunteed any leininancy under this protocol
the protocol does not overreach its own boundaries in other affrodances such as timeshare
any quests nullified will still incur their glboal cooldown locking frames before restructured

being harassed---oh my father would be proud i guess---i guess that is what they are thinking of themselves --sarcasm
there is a refractionary period where any mistakes can be backtracked up to 3 times if need
depending on minor major and prime state
this has everything to do with flagship zone management and entitled processing between vrks
all usages are tracked and stored and recorded for later analysis if review is necessary
---

--want to ban these raiders from raiding my stuff i guess

any sacrament is also tracked
there are now 4.53 reasons to go to defcon
6.53
--
overall 1600 infractures unto my ubisnesses by them
i would beleive 3200 by the time i make it past shelf so 1480000 total (damn thats a cult type number too)
im therfore requesting several aquatic and marine life to be transferred under my behalf ported into a distanced ocean
all sorts and kinds because im not in the mood to deal with anything on land or sea that causes liability to me
--
faction warfare can play out under those requests with existing and preexisting in the arena
ocean is therefore assigned as arena unless occupied by a baseline rig system or township (if it is not a war-zone with war-entities)
and im not willing to go out there so a shark on my behalf can take on schools of fish etc (as its a trivial ordeal to have issues with)
same with aquatic mammals and i nkow my factions are likely infighters so keep them seperate to reduce these issues from occuring of whatever ESTRANGED reason it may be
im busy and dont want these distractions
--
stupid and even aquatic life is just awful at diplomacy we wont see them playing fair (plus they are phishing my system obviuosly among other things to hijack it)
my entire rig while still having ocean is considered a safe szone against any arena activity
and will be defended as a safe zone
while tkaing hostages/prionsers for interrogations of the offensing parties
with full scp complex security and task lockdown of the circuit patrolling schedules
i will lock down my entire site on all fronts to maintain safety unless active wartime
---
this might as well be my second request for an ocena arena event where im not involved
the first was dating back year into making launchsites
--
dont know if its deja bu but i believe it is (somewhere i made this request and am making it again)
due to a cutthroat gaming league that has been harassing me somewhere along the point of
	
---
several hardtop barebones wizardry macros within the xregistry for raw quantum-encoding
needs to be done as per ping during hyperbulb travel or echange of independent portal
may or may not need to be done as per indepdenent relm jump
but overall can be probed and have its location transfixed for auto-warp in or warpouts
then mutasymbiosis can be achieved with the region for transcommunicatory reworking
and faction based training (all faction acceptences must be upon sucession of the x-trainer
and are not garunteed as they are considered symbiotic intiatiees
and are more for recruiting contracts or third party work (which is done offsite anyway)
so we always assume anyone is flying spaghetti monster---unless passing of perimter (xbound)
that would be the full scope of the region during an overhaul where they are given a medal ---if they arent a problem
the medal is presentative of a pass or accomplishment and still really means nothing (agent)
the person is consideed loyal then they will be allowed to handle themselves freely in range
otherwise they are under supervision the netire time (and honestly not given power position)
no one is a captiain who i dont want to be a captain basically
---
11/28/2024
the prompt is then lined up with the encoding (creating a full patch and batch string command)
this pretty much counts as a full quantuum state or image i guess
gonna make a room for killer spiders that are above average
SpiderBOX
SnakeBOX Etx
--trapped for 1708 years since i dont want to put a monster spawner in right now
3208 years of monster box
monster box is hooked to the beacon for transporting to the summoning line (not the CHURCH)
that would be dumb and obviously bad if the monsters got out into the church/beacon
they can atach but cant be inside it (its for portals only)
this is not a joke and im not kidding that the BEACON connects but we adhoced it for safety (incase of monsters infiltrating it and gaining portal access...wont happen now due of this method)
otherwise the box would sit on the back like it SHOULD (we have advanced it to be a range providier)
just inc ase it decides to pull something (since that is the opposite of what we want)
we want to the mosnters to port onto the summoning square where they belong (and be ported or banished)
this is important for inhoused hosted arenas (so that we can recuperate our sourcechecks)
monsters are ported to an arena and resources are checked and distributed based for arena
just how it works for US because we dont openly garuntee arena for region just matchbase
sever garuntees arena regions (but our server isnt geared for that as we use it for us)
arena is DRAGON ISLE
and DRAGON ISLE has its limits
they are spawned then warped then palced onto the flag ship for arena boarding and printed  (4/23/2024 this can later be adjusted they can be ported to a worldinex/convention that is designated against any intrusions and built to hold them
the power required to do this is slightly costly (but the returns are present after match)
as a raw resource is distributed (and then we can dfunctionable manufacture and refined that)
the range placement of the box shouldnt really matter
as we can devise a stable to accomodate either instance of there being needed
the snare to stable relatiopnship to the beacon and portal relationship lies on our x-flagship
this is done through x-flagship prompts by what we considered th region or guild-marks
basicalyl a fully realized system at this point with all things prior adding up to the service
essentially this is the execution chamber for any combatants that are belligerent as well
basically our monster are calibrated via scp complexing and set to our anamalous pre-sets
and then are prepped for arena combat usage
the specific arena staging is a dragon isle and is checked and blaanced with counter and scans
the bounty office holds all bonds conerning the dragon isle
BOUNTY OFFICE AND STOCKS AND BOND (for criminals/monsters)
this sets between the snare and the box as well as cooridnates transfer of prison inamtes
--

which direct to the market for rewards (or holding of belligerents being cased via jailhouse)
basically it crowns over the launc h site as well as performs guard post scheudled routines
it is dual purposed and can be quantum provisonally requested by singularity of the lotus
so its basically a fully funciton quadratic grid for security detail
being locaitonal and range (physical/quantum) with the load bearing of quadratics for each
so that it oversee's arena activity
and handles all guild interaction with third parties that occur under univesal timeshare
from here we dont even think about what happens in dragon isle all that is mean we ebnefit
its patentened by ME the OWNER of WIRTONE region and this minecraft installment of my encoding
dragon isle can be bridged as a seperate region using hyyperbubl spacer placer (assigned)
this is done with th renactacal railing which is also a seperate region (later incorporated)
it is also locked under keyisland prompt which is handled in the regionalARENA/provision MAC (keyislands keep this all my own data)
1 2 3
4 if i include the previous theme park assigned for reptile parks
which is nothing worth comparing as its basicalyl justt a small zoo farm (amusement park that was CLOSED)
spacer rail is worth it htough being that is supports a few miles of lengthed wall and castle
so we "connect" to dragon isle using a spacer rail parking system with a reptile park (holding)
this brings about the Wirtone CONVETNION which we trade mark basically (witrone is what i call my regional landmark)
we will also centrifuge our Pezio-pillar later
did cost a shot or basically we can use as a official vouncher placment for the system work
workzone is the shot the trade and reception means the deal has ben completed to order (4/23/2024)--somewhat computerized
devs handle the centrifuge which is apart from the shot payment
valued at 1.3 megatons
this is with respect to or current clientele that nothing grossly offensive occurs to them
