FIRST OFF all these entries more or less had a PICTURE to go with them but like...it would be 40 gigs of pics or something I couldnt upload it (GuDAMMIT!)
This is so painful I wish I had a text log of everything I wrote but I dont!! :(
3 years of notes LETS GO!:
This was done on a system of a Ryzen-7 with a 5500xt-gpu and 128ram (i would upgrade the ram later and just lose data constantly becuase of Computer being over-used constantly and my lucky cat knocking my hard drive and losing data!) 
oh joy~

A****
ANYWAYS IM GOING TO USE THIS AS THE DEBUG FILE THAT CHECKS EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE SINCE IM REWRITING IT (ITS A DOUBLE CHECK SYSTEM BY NOW)
*****

Keep in mind sometimes this is bullshit when dealing with minecraft thats why some of these rules are just straight up bullshit:
also people tend to arm up against others and revolt when inventions are taking place (we respond with warnings depending on severity)-so thats why inventions kinda should be hush hush alot i guess ( i just say i will dfend myself if i have to)
also my thought processes might get in the way and i will have to explain both textually and visually somtimes twice over a thing (its endearing)
often times i need to say stuff before i do it because i dont have the motivation nor do i have the support (sometimes i have zero of BOTH)

Knytt island was designated on 2020-04-18 (the launch site is unshielded too)
3294 grievanaces calculated (Foxant Town and Nowheresnt Town)
Frigate is also unshielded and we are adding on modules (smoke and chaffe)
its main gun is build and so are the smaller ones (the SS NEO-Nep)
we start making rooms inside the hull
thermal torpedo/ battery manufactoring (it feels like 103.7 megatons of work..we exagerrate ALOT)
the motorcage/enginehead  ---  ship thrusters (battery fueld well) (power core and drone barracks)

transparency zingstation (x-zing station)  = right solidarity (left epoxy fitting)
left alternation (we build the shield in a full bender of a storm)

small residence>powerstation>guardstation>nuclearstation

the psychophants asylum (never really used)
speculating more buildings (we already built everything on it just reviewing it)
a wheel cover idea which uses plasma cross tacking
a relay base for paradise lounging in foxtopia (we made it)
the underground hotel network (contiguity residences)
the nal homunculi
say production for a year was worth 5k earth days in which i would lose a good deal of money (300dollars)
the work outputs a fatestone---(this is a prediction of any stone but we made lichstones afterwards of the fate tier)
a big beacon
color coding shields
animal round up and some memes (fargo meme "shut the fuck up donny lol)
goading other rival territories by making statements about being serious and threatning (be careful of this)
building a clutch and box for headquarters i guess
furaschen utopian world
building the logistics rails (not a full roadway of the airzone)
"a nuetrino metal nuke big enough to take out the north eastern countries"--this was a demand that was bearing down on me whether i beleved in it or not

making a semitruck (or quantum light collider)
well station viewport/ pet memorials (later becomes an ai tulpetic trainer)
deep tower scenario / light base training (being insulted) / umbral base sealed chamber (projection of a holofield) / wild wood training (for pets)/ plasma combat/ acrobbatic training (exo required)

synch chamber/ connector viewport

security site of umbral base and sureveying
railing midplates
a remward (hell of a reach when it was made)

a second run of a mag lev (researching)
(christmas is approaching at 2020-12-17)

shots of the first dragon aux and the nuke near it
nether panels and pigs (we also released a ghost into the real world for funs sake---i wonder if we can get back to capturing it now that all this has passed)

frigate training and the nexues is still being built and barely started really
hardening alloted (quality control) certified encryption active torpedo bay and factory
rocket factories for weapons ( a barracks utility and kitchen)
engine room and boiler room (munitions and charge array for power)
nuclear base well (the eactor of the frigate)
on board drone lift (drone combat deploy)  -- medicale/support food and supply

--building our own alcatraz for rogues and rebels to be incinerated if a threat (they are recycled into the system as carbon money)---they was never really explained
--but it is part of how things owrk we cremate the unwanted criminals (we later made peace with them to reduce this practice)
center trun load reserve (weapons and power structures)  -- support branch technical personal
shields and shield genetaors with mechanical repairs (primitive shielding still virtual though)
unit stations and gun battery reserves (technical cartirdges

scoping out areas with gates and ;rison requests of criminals
the gooZEbrick (a gulag)--also the frigate is completed

nuclear waste storage in a desert
quarantine data rooms
double ring duct house
(Do not allow enders or Trickledowns) -- has this protocol been held up these years (hopefully)
6k drones and strieks contracted over career so far at 2020-12-23 (heavy feels from building..its an exagerration)
43k targeted people who have made their presence hostile (this may be true)---it remainds me of several war conscripts that occured later

the project had become a MIND-SNAPPINGLG EXCRUTIATING TOUR-DE-FORCE of SUFFERING AND BUILDING (many would have had their breaking point now)
the words written that if you do not abuse magic to begin to dream and ti reutnrs favors for your modesty
magic was really spoken of (but we frown upon it)--it simply doesnt need to be done

the deserted server (the quarantine)
the complexes the simulator the ocean rig lift
the rem facility the lucid rail skips the magic
alchemy process 1-7 double (a building excuse)

we are beginning to build the business tower
the strata-prism quintic(a very rare tier property)--think of super molecular trisomes over a chemical-induced drug starata (it functions as drug tears basically)

a quadlocker medbump and bagdock for travel examinations
the building of the quantum light facility (captures a particle needed for the EXALTE-Rad)--this would likely refer to certain other particles (we are still finding out)
the exalterad is quadlocked by orbital nuetrinos and acts as hot metal (we discover the melted meta plates)
blue hot metal (supperaltive process over subnet run)--this later became the tri-crystalization of the relm-melding processes

the nuke is advanced by ventricles and scapulature (not sure how to describe siometrics but that it what i meant) --via alchemy (using melt plates)

prism isometric quasied (well i guess i did)
123 isometric bevel quasified and then fractaled
basically - slanted->gilded->heographed
then it is made a prism shaped like a starprint(describing what an ender portal is)
the anamoly is cinched and bound or bridled (describing processes)

forced to run the entire test
if it is passed it is sent to asylum
put to sleep and sent on its wa
dropped of here many anamolies who have been cleared by checky

produce capsule of essence
nightamre horse sign
potential anamoly
the bellwire
outer gondola (for esorting them into training)

beginning the synthaesia units for prism enhancements
the tulpa rides through the chamber and pressurizes a carbon token used for peacemel or ballistic power (glad we deicded that)
ahead is the later half of the build 70+30 roads (oh this is a small description of what we actually built)
it tied into 70+30 carriers we had built making it half (alot of tie ins went unmentioned this happened more and more incrementally as we developed)(more of them)
ocean road (medival sim) - analog road (carrier) and lastly the REMCenter  (foxVilla)

outer onboard router system
routinely surveys inamates

the four building swamp forest mountain field
flayer seiker red task (worm) man eater plant (monsters that i thought were good names especially REDTACK being descriptor)--later retack becomes a loic strike zone akira
the synth logics are compelted (nebuilzieing room)--long tunnel was built (and it would be built later and elongated)
a chimeny area and steam vent (a meltdown junk area just in case)

biometrics check station
security post (complete lockdown full perm)--analmalous asylum
(a little mad i messe dup in a game even tho i was arguing how i won)
explaining a biolab or asylum--the tribes are inciting war between other tribes (we have moved on from that bullshit and this project took hold and we ignored them)
--we later come back with a giant vengeance obviously with an akira-field

making the light chamber of the collider a party room
trying to save small villages with safety scaping and quarantines

comm relay / biometrics lab
cryptobyte pit
safeguard travelling merchant housing
multiplicty station/(normalizing) remote and saturn safety (agfainst crazyass saturnization)
anamolous chekcing board and remote asylum
plex station (money exchanger primitive)

(my gall bladed systemss got out of control on 2020-12-26 just to note that it wasnt until march-2023 i nearly died from it)
tulpas served 13,042 (assuming how many good guys we have)
SCPS served 132+(how many people we dont consider good)--it incereases but thats where we were at
multiplex station (a better plex station)
remote plex service desk (our reach is increasing slowly)
the minibox (a funzone)
11-13 lanes total
1st axul-furance 2nd reactor store 3rd afterbviralFac
4th ocean nav 5th semi-analog 6th carrier analog (the frigate) 7th the road(referring to the nexus strip) 8th road2(reffering to the drift lane)
9th afterocean 10th (quadbuilding) 11th bioplex (referring to collider)12-13 are DUBlane (becoming the business tower)
for instance viral branch can fit into a dublane 
branch offs go into dublames of which i currently have two spare (i dunno what i meant but it was a degree of building planning)
turning lanes into horizones (six or so lanes side by side)
will fit the square grid work of this complex tulpasect (we didnt infact we converted it into a giant endzoning operation)
describing the plot of land i own (one lane is also one horiozon long so i own a flat (of those things)
i also have a 4 castle road that can border the full map (this was a reference to what i integrated over the air field as a counting system)
"describing full map views is estimated at 20 to 24 lanes of complexes)
13 _4 or so at 17  leaving room for 3-7 doubles if i count park *(dumb mathh that might become prevalant in some dumb way)
every 4 castle a double and the road as a double
that is a full mapview more or less especially with centerPark (describing the RoadPark I made that i later broke apart and lined end to end)
Rechanent Aug 2019-2020DEC (if i ever combine them it will look pretty good on a chart---well i did)
estiamted 600 hours at full work zone (it became way way way way more hours than that)
this was all for a tulpa sect (at the time a particle designed to assist in tulpa-ambience and tulpafication--revisiting it now we have just made that at most--at least we have tons of other substitutes)--including the akira module becoming a "sugared-quotient"--so we are basically good to go on the "tulpasect"ing
synch ouphe or manadrake (turns out it was synchouphe mostly--and a little manadraking- with crystals anyway)mostly just ouphe+sylphetyic gossamer made from oil-symbiotes

uses carbon plex quanta (and now we know it uses alot more too)
foxvilla quarantined (6)--1 major and 2 raid clears (we did a few more than we started shielding our launch sites and would outreach them with rail systems too)
ender portal activated 1 (at west)---well (we revisted them 6 or 8 times lol)
victim of dejavu x100 + 1 full map dejavu case and minorDope (one case of drug doping from third pary unknown attacker)--this was my gallbladder attack scare meth thing
i ask them to consider my rights and know its my life and thhat i think they were jealous
made area a no drug no smoking and no drinking area (or its no fun mode)
(in honor of my pets signs)
estimated 6 minite full speed flight and 15 minutes at full run

made a spawn asylum too
adjacent room view in this case back at the collider
there is a mid capsule to view sides in a tunnel (because tulpetic training you might want to see)
unassisted training
suit assisted training
produces mild carbon quotients (what doesnt)
making it like a dungeon basically (before i really had a good grasp on bigger dungeons)
anamoly stockhold (dangerous) area --imagine like a payon meets the skeleton caves
later becomes overloaded or haywire during evac (like a structucal fallout)
can be spectated but is considered an audit for non-participants
such in this case a spectral mare
a bagging station
we describe the old net encoded particles and a grafting of silicone used for laminate and containg it
the layer was very thin and may be optional for turretting (alot of things get cheapened but they are also because of mass capabile prododuction-its calculatedly secure)
partice docking using algorithms in desgined AI (this wasnt even a thing we were doing that year)--it hadnt even kicked off but it kinda did
designated for Clipper Base (we are making shit up but clippers were basicalyl fletched encode decorums)
designated for pincers base i.e. shears (this was based off a scissor monster from faria that needed silver arrows...hmm its strange how i dont mention the similarities)
a caliper device that literally strips the object to bare essential
also considered dangerous ofr high lethality so no subjects
this bridge was for remedial things such as the GateLense (wasnt sure if it was or not remedial just saying)
Just a border Plate for passing into areas for other 
objects on this bridge would include old world office boxes
such as lever crank switch complex to include others
4-5 complexes here not sure
a filamentary compelx to handle the bomb cover mixed in consoles
a wire wrapping was used to secure it fully in combine
a sort of loomlike effect on threads the cottonCombine etc
uses rare cogs or sprockets too like a cotton candy machine (later we make a virtual version of this tnear the virtual-bridging)
but its weaponized
so more like a death rope storm (this became a thing we dealt with and secured safely)
with wires connecting to the sides etc and using old encode (describing a metal-carrion)
looks like the metal symbiotyate nueron device aka the augor (began to compare to slivers later)
it gets upgraded too later in the buildings ahead
for instance the sprocket and cog sets and pin sets and toolkits
nuerotic symbiote / networks or alignments that are not preset
as per agasinst the router
once encrpted it reaches quarantine for some shelf time
far corner plexing is considered operational here (at the collider)
the asylum handles delicate linear procedures
 invlding the augors or tulpas (augors=mech) they combiner them into the nuclearRemWell to develop a carbon plex to fuel Rem Drift hence all the Testing (it is done over a pctech regime) that monitors its progress and catalogs any details so that it can alchemized a saturn particle (this became a diplated particle later)
That is used for onboard tasking and power packs for site management. it is normalzied to maintain the tulpasect subjects
Is considered a morae or hypermana depending on use

BackenTrance via MineVent Sealed Off
Our Imprisoned ONIMARK (core at the frigate) Do not Release
Spawn Center "Lunar Canvas: surprise tent (i dont know) -we build the spawn tent then

this is probably enough to justify camuse (a cop out) festival
survelliance light box to make sure no stoweaway
more effectively to prevent sabotage or anamalous attack
cart chekcing station and sruvelliance
uses a flash pulse from a light box based on carbon quotients
this is like a cel scanner using dpi it drops in a scan via strobe launch
the raidbox transport vessel (end of drift lane)
transport fully subdued apprehended unit (later soldier classes)
use of medical droid only

the world breaker fit into a strobe qiuth a quantum quotient partice (using halfset wiring)
also known as world pillar (does not need it but i dunno i can put it in a lunar terminal)---nexus still not built at all
basically a bubblewand known as a lunar colum (this would later be for lich stone cleaninsg i bet)
lunar gate / solar gate (describing what miaybe would soon end up being what i build as the tower)
that uses the blewtip and firework stuff (extremities in encoding --dynamites) --that means nether gate liekly (on a combine)
at peace mel or the spark of that fills with on pc/pa level (still a primiteive level of development its good enough) - as a quad gate
just a big onimarker (---which is what we secure with the akira field way way wyy way lter)
minibox filigree (of course) (onimarker)----world is fighting again --dispatch with zombies to force unsettling presences===its basically their fault for making warcall

8/8/2023


uses encoding of hodgepodge(mulligan) borgin/aviatics 4 raspberry (of the onimarker)/quadgate/fatestone
specialized gating makes a fatestone
"buildinf of the logic gate the first golgathic instance and stadium)
oni kiosk/synthetic peg/fall of warning (bizniz tower)
---toll booth made with synethic peg---locked entry to pay to kiosk (asked for carbon quantas as payment for entry or transport)/multipass
--lunar outpoisting portal to the cli-citaldel-(Ahdelyra is the citydel that is like a foundation for resturants or "slaughterhouse/smokehouse"
other suggested names:(interesting might develop into a locational array for paradoxing)
descartes/portalast/peralex/nupital tower/ libram litany/mega-atrium/exoEcosun/therausm(theater + masueleum)/crucible/heloison/pinnacal/paramount-etc/mura cosco/tsurachasm/horizona/havanae/ankh-kehatal/

this signifies when eurptions takes palce on the core maybe thru bazaar which would work for (the iconograph)--(turns out we use the bazaar at zerobouquet for this purpose_)
ir bezier depending on what i can get away with
will require ritual circle (not sure tho)

beginnning to make the tower for business (start entirely by making frames and stacks) then make a main lobby area with side parts to each side is an elevated stair case or ladder set etc and mix and matches with connectiovity
planted the symbols on it s well (lunar soloar) making the tulpetic bridge for itself (great job now for later)

talkeda bout making a 20sq mile sanctuary for growing trees and basically a states worth of 3000squaresmiles
a 100k dollar project over 6 months for drone power and drone work and drone labor (in order to achieve this)--forestry resourcing
talking avbout converting 54 miles to cover 5 or 10 miles worth of road base in resourcing for the grail
while protecting endangered shit
entering the ender portal
ending the first dragon
looting around the ender zones

building a tank garage
tulpasec is nuclear container and wil make a launch
offices and light array to handle ouphe generation form tulpatic pressures (taoking about ender men too)
ouphe will become an ouphe synth (cynch) or even a remhandler (able to do everything i need it to as far as ambient systems concenred--it can corral animals or minions for me etc)
spo thats expenseive resourcing and supplies
talkng about making an scp board and putting a little metroid in it thru a world column (did this havent done the metroid part for reasons--i can think about using one though now)
talking about making a little metroid getting synched and ouphed (blacked and whited)---now im just calling that limbification
suggesting quarantined terraium and full factory crafts and a marktt ( i did this)
making super begetabils (vegatble foodstuffs i did basically---now we use black ice mineralfication and such)
making super fertilizer and using colored light and mineral soil (made this useful)
fully secure with tank garage so basically im ooking at what im talking about
just expound on this and make it its own thing really its a 5x  build (for quasis)
basically its own hoirzone that will make 25 or so more supplied from it
also the biome generator that is 8 types by 8 floors that are mixed and constantly kept(cleaned or swept)
so 64 biomes ---trying to make a mega-mcdonalds stables (i basically did this later at another location)
a 24+1 hoirzone sanctuary with its own qurantine and shielding
that will be done when the walls are up around the woodslnads i will use the space to set
a nursey for trees and replanting to the side instead of centering it and the city
can be paralell to that so a 25 horizone next to the same thing (basically a remote horizone which was scrapped in favor of regional platitudes being side by side)
50% of the space involved in a "full square mile basically"
if i choose that very large pact of land which i should and can (verifiying what i can and cant do..pro tip i verified i can do everything legally or in a matter of reason)
it will be a quad horizone at somepoint anyway
so50% should be martialized and the others are gentrified margins of it (talking about satuarated an encampment for a purposed operation)
basically the fruits of labors of all the oriognial labor will come to fruition (yeah i said that part lol)
by the way the tulpasec using an already known missile gold missile schematic used for the iconograph elite tulpas (duno some bullshit im trying to explain)
we will have to graduate to use of gargoyles or the imp based guardians (we graduated alot actually and settled for a sergal dire before becoming full felkins, we called these the viscounts later)
so what im thinking is a monster land to the side and then an immersion land of some sort (this became dimensions)
probably just minicultures of subdandoms like mlp and otaku shit (trying to consolidate other genres)
so my sewrious side, the monster side, and the hapless sides (me categorizing the setups to other genres)
Lost Light Box of Cyto Scursia (it was forgotton too during constructions lol...light boxes are essentially lit echo boxes we never used them but that can be qlamps now)
Lost Cyto Light box of Scryora / Scyralhe (sky rail)

100 rolled up tapes including non builts in prior and aa scyralh (me planning the roadways)
the give extras not counting them yet
they will be like 20 for sure just count them as fox town i guess
spending time in the business tower perfecting forges and soul-rotial tables (for business purposes that i know would become important with anamolie being collected the way they were)
xcryption (resurrecting anamolies through the business tower)
scryption combines 2 encryptions duble-cytos (some crazy thing)
alot of back and forth roadway checking and maintaence looking out
described in value as .931 megatons for the tower weights

for those opposed we will be withdrawing their funds and liquidating their account (in response to warring and comative hostile tribers-fuck em)
as a first war rule order ( i felt safe enough ahving made a frigate and roadway to state these in declaration in case it occured)
the second of course is violence (the physical aspects of retaliations---diplomacy is lost)
21 days as a tank look up a scrht
correction / on month of 31 days cuz 5 days on destroyers and spaas (talking about when the war was breaking out---after they took away my kyota i had warthudndered alot)
what guns doest 13 shots at once cuz that is the gun i need pistol clip wise ( i needto shoot something 13 times ritualistically maybe)-to convert it by the process we use
the commericla with the stupid fire fighter nurse and toilet paper mascot dancing pinacle pineapple american shit (there was dumb shit all on tv alot)
have fun with your corona shit (i thin i was making the commercial part up)
kkk did nashville bombing that is because they hate black people (me coming to terms with at & t attacks)
your end game to nuke us s known we nuke too, as would bne strategy, we should nuke anyways
if they want to fight we should nuke them
zero remorse for the dead
sparkle city for your face (me being mad about anything i guess and trying to cope with the rage of building and being contested for it)
if you want to play happy time murder we will just cut to the chase and nuke (this was when happy time murders came out and i didnt want to watch it at all)--cuz its a cop-out of a movie
on the matter of personal accoutnability we're not the ones dead for anything (this is me just justifying having to say relaly rude shit) and not taking credit for being the one that says it because i had to say it at all
you kow how it is get to the slave farm and torture-works until you make my stuff (basically me setting the groundworks for this regimist attack on what would happen and i know it would be that way)
farms and resources and wood and metals
whip them to death if it means our survival, im not dying over this dumb crap (destitution)
im not suffering for your own bullshit (me just saying it for the sake of saying it)--shit was miserable

they keep threatening us every step of the way for years:
uses inverse supporting too so dont tell me its structural business plus its weighted (so thats how it is stfu)

Building Scaling Safety:
outside for atuthorized personal only
rappels in must be in use at all times
i start making map signs and stuff and posts for directions
i make the sign to BUY ELITE CARBON PASS

seems like the way th e world works is that in death we just turn into cosmic concepts
tax the farms for our side
those with CARBONPASS have lowered travel times
astral fire generator
Start making the railways throughout the area
AsylumHyperCom (referring to the world collider pa and comms relays)
blackhole generator (we make better black  holes since this was installed and we essentialyl upgraded our original blackholes)
laser generator
super particle generator makes laser gravity beams (thats great)
helps to deter or control tulpatec outbreaks (war zones or riots)
start making our first tulpetec model (based on peruvian soldiers in ivory armor)
filigree ribbon (bug cut marquis) onimarker soldier
these traits make for the light drive
the wards distribute light to a dropper (they are acting agressive in my neighborhood)

discussing how to build a small system before this takes off just felt like discussing another system (a mini-grail)--which i havebt been allowed to do since im being held hostage) but i am writing it in another document.
this mini grail will simply force a farm-area and platnatation and orchard int oa fenceline and use water power or a mini-aux to make power while using a cabin as a base of operations and then a gas reactor/control rod reactor
to fruther establish automation of animal by products and fertilizers thriving off their locale conditions---then it attaches to a microwave-rpcoessing food processing facility and hashes out full meals based off a limibsource

this causes lots of heat the heat is used for power
technically it burns so hot it creates a black hole
the black hole is exteinguished with a light warp

woopsie i relapse a little but its ok
9/21/2023 picking this up again writing out another few or the whole thing
Here is the OUTPORT from the inport (psyche tho i actually just wrote this twice for no reason because i forgot where i was)(so im using it as the outbound logic gate side to exist the simulation/stadium or a full gate passage too from out and in at the same spots)
world pillar lunar colum
cause for lunar gate or somethin
solar gate
a confetti gate
that uses that blewtip shit and the firework shit (ignitor)
that means nether gate likely
signifies when eruption takes place on core
at peacemel or the ... sparkof that fills with on pc/pa level
that shit is a quadgate
just a big onimarker
signifies when eruption takes place on core at the palace/corestand

maybe thru bazaar which would work for the iconograph (which is the thing we can use at the end of all of this anyway)
or bezier depending on what i can get away with
will require a ritual circle
from the raid ritual circle camp
this is the last piece
it fits in the quad gate
the quadgate (fatestone)-onimarker

the logic gate basically:
uses encoding of 1hodgepodge 2borging 3aviatics and 4: raspberry(diametrics)
specialized gating makes it also a fatestone
(building it up with four panels of nether gates and reinfoced socketing and the glass entry and waypoint setting
later i lock it up with encryption and keys and actual sigils and doors

ok back up to speed and talkinag about light generation and blackholes

Describing the warsoldier and light process using alchemy or gematria
----HERE We go
the light power is lightstoned if not, purpur or diamond rich ore is produced (carbonrich)
purpuris considered carbon rich it can be fuel
it is used as drone fuel for our soldier
soldier type 2
second edition first edition was lost somehow  --not sure what i meant by that i think im just lazy and maknig it a lore issue (we cna clal it a pirate drone later)
we coat our drone in a gold and iron(silver)
then put it into a vessel it is soothed with emerald minerals
otherwise it returns to a tulpatec warstate
the gold plate is triage flux with gold silver iron
it is mixed to form a bevel rasp folds
this is a x3 trait as well
and regular power of auxillary as a x3 trait
this combination of power forms a carbon power
the carbon power turns black with quantum turning in time
the light is uses can also be turned in time causing redlight
the black light (purpur) redlight (redstone)
this is an x3 trait that light is pink
this forms a yellow light (or plasma)
creates a laser prism or an (end prism)
yellow+pink
it will turn into purple light if rich in carbon
white light
regular white light turns blue in quantum
normal side
purplelite is considered very risky
will turn to a black lite
will turn into carbon lites over time then back to regular
battery lite
auxillary power
dipolated light
batteries can sustain pink and yellow
showing the formula for making dipolated batteries
this can be fed into an auxillary to make full again (using the auxillary to charge it)
it also sustains onishards and onimarkers and onicores
i can link the image later: its literally a split block top and bottom with a purple block in the center, reaching out to a pink and yellow area (P=black red green) and (Y= white and blue) and a side pane that drops carbon(grey) to side-central dependent tech(carbon) and then to diamond when purple is mixed (its not complicated and actually i like how simple it looks using a center pane inside a top.bottom adjusted side for A and B with a full sidemargin drop to diamond at the bottom) so that pink and yellow combine into -->purple--->tech---->diamond as carbon continues to drop-line (the refining process is evident and can be auxilliarated)

adding bells and whistles and labels and decals and podiums and switches and lights

describing the tulpetic guardian soldier:
pro tip these are not the simpsons mascot masks
tyrmatio the gargoylan
a gargoyal hardens at day risk of exposure to others
any thing it touches it may decripy into stone if it wants
it seeks out warriors that have chosen to fight it
it is powered by diplated lite that recharges itself in a day
it wears ancient chain mail that is half mail half chain mesh
two wingedbardiches that it uses for fight and flight
it may employ sentry wards on either of its side (they use orbitals)
is agility based but also strength based simply put also dexterity

dserve its own room but IT ships fast since last room was a quad
so it gets wards two total with orbitals because of the quad base
it also has a damage aura and protective shielding
as a counter act and is not delayed and is uninterruptable
uses special move CURSEtouch which slows and petrifies
its hit causes Curse Touch hitting it also causes status
it travels at .5 horizons a second (may be exagerrated or not idc)
and can dash for a .75 of a horizon instantly
its best move is xdash which randomly strieks multiple areas
in a dashing formation sometimes two at once
its wards can cast cyclone and aero
and cast orbitals
but the wards are subteraneous
and will continue to summon orbtitals and heal
killing the wards will force an eclipse for the fight to occur
day night doesnt matter at night it is in full power
with full buff and curtse auras
the aura becomes a instant aoe and causes splash damage
sunder attacks the entire area in random locations
and a second solar flare can result if sunder lasts
even during x-dash and other casts
this will create a chain of sunder and solar flares
target also casts paralysis and zealous corruption
this heals wards and overthealing wards will case a full regen buff
ohase two the boss is buffed and is solo
in phase 2 he casts astral immolation that causes burn
in phase three astral immolation is always active (turns nite to day)
in phase threee he does not stop until all is burned
his wards are floating onigraph that have dipolated orbitals (in the harcore mode that can light up their iconographic details as well and become way stronger)
the onigrapgs are shaped like flying shrimpies
their oribtals are blue glinting blitz stars
onigraph/oribtal/onigraph caccoon stage/ cyclone cast b y onigraph/aera bolt cast by orbital/ ghost strike hits random nearby target

spectal well this is combined nuclear well with a receptacle
it HOUSES the cytoneuron suite and tulpas and routes them
this causes a dark radiation to occur it is actually the last room
built after alot because i forgot to add it or maybe i didnt
we would be dealing with raw corruption if we skipped it
raw corruption tends to reach very deep states and zergs
we need to constantly flush the well chamber
luckily swamp right here
luckily natural swap
nuclear well and receptacle
comms relay
Well chamber

BIOMETRICLAB
asylum (the asylum is for tulpas and cryptids)
it has an onimark and onishard and oni core all in one
its called the minibox
it generates blackholes
the asylum is a black hole generator
this is a dipolate light generate next to the black hole generator
it also makes tulpatic armor and large synch gearing
synch are considered aurapaths or remhandlers
wizards to warriors really
a sieker is much stronger than a regular nepling
siekars are also capable of theramancy but are primal
so while we combined our elites into new stronger forms
the gargoyal idea was tossed because of the imps
it just made sense so we settled for it
it is our best chaince against any Onimark outbreaks
with it we can bridge both nether and ender dimensions and fight the Onimarker using Dipolated light (now we can use it for energy matter conversions as a superbridge)
and secure our QuadGate
Even the lethal blow it recieves is also dealt to its opponent
the onimarker is strong and rivbals its attacker in everyway
it is the scorpion strike it uses that will always be unavoidable
out robotic gargoyle will return in the day whole once again
as we capture the eco-power of the onimark for ourselves
using it for astral purposes
we wil combine our powerful lights and eco and dipolted lite
and form the ankkehetal promise for our lost ones
they will form a helix of light and darkness and lead us to utopia
the utopia of skyrahle

discussing dipolation side effects (depending on which polar adjustment)
redstone light (onimark)
chemilite (pink)
chemiplasma (purpur)
asteral lite (skyrahl lite) green terracotta-plasma
comes from dipolated and chemi-plasma very rare
spectralite acomes from astra
and akcghemized battery lite of pink yellow dipolated chemi
hitech mix of colored and carbon
very rare lite side
astral lite takes 2
yellow blue red and green make crying obsidian or just spec+carbon
importnat to know in integrated light boards or rawcraftinglite
later will make easy nanobattery using this method with a receptacle
regular carbon mixed with other blueobsidian makes nano
THIS PART FOR BIOMETRICS

talking about how i will have 13 ships
the one the inverted the ergonomic the gentrified
the turbo drive the hyper drive for nuclear the integrated the non-integrated
the hybrid the electric, the onimarker, the astral marked, and some stealth assed militarized
then backward and all kinds of shit for mining ... for holding .. for transport for barge

integrated allocated for oni shit introverted extroverted
that 8
that 8 and the 1 is hyper drive drive turbo drive (astral spectral ok)
thirteen would be just made stealth
cuz its basically backwards as shit its fully

then a mining a barge carrying tug a transporter and a big haul for fishing
so 13 to 17 electrical hybrid 18 19 20 would be just a tank holder
so 20 frigate

then iguess an omni quad frigate of 4 of the first
then i guess an omni quad frigate of quadset first quadset second quadset third

then i guess an omni quad frigate of quadset first quadset second quadset third so 20+4

the nuclear recon hybrid electical (stealth would be fourth quad so that shit)

then a utility mod of scanging mining fishing and barging
so 26

then a frigate that is omni and holds tank and does all that and is stealth reconed

then a frigate that is omni and holds tank and does all that and is stealth and reconed so 27

the first 9 are for big pull uses the second 9 are for psysop mobile operation fob claiming

the third 9 are just for fucking fun
i can only fit like 8 in here on this side

the last one is a doozy

then i guess i can fit a cruise liner with a tower on it that is raft
so 28 or 4 sets of 7 instead of 3 big ones
it would be like have 27 and 28 working together as 55 or however many
make anothe to pretend to carry all my routes which are like 13 horizones

to pretend to carry all my routes which are like 13 horizones so i would need at least 4 each
that like 32

might as well be 64 its gonna be that hard
got plenty of gimmicks to go around there
might as well build a prison boat

might as well build a prison boat so 65
honestly you arent much of a threat to have 67 ships of all god damn creation
plus the weird ones like in the movies

basically take all the stuff i made so far and lane it up on flat ground and cover it
and thats a big square of land that is kinda tall at some pot and sunk in the center
put fox ville in the center and have it portected by the carrier on the outside as an island
foxville is already shapred like a spaceship so just be likely spacedomes for foxues
and the ships come and go and just like any other carrier imo
this is gonna have to work that way for awhile

each carrier has a big ass land quad and a foxille to consider on top it makes sense

exhaust pipe for quadphotonic
quadratic photon + astral burning
exhaust pipes for front and or back
heating bar for exhaust
creates dark astral motes

lost lite pool
this is a soul catcher but can be used as an opened pit
swirling pool
(swrl+sqrl)
the last loop basically two combi complex set of 5
darkgatehive_
lite/hvy security cytolab
skyrahl,(12345)
these mix with a lockdown, medbay, encryption, the clipper, clouddock
as is called fob research or 5x double complexes

so i dont have to build 10_
based on the last horizones disco very
by cloud dock i mean the it-interface/inteferences
and i dont want them to be offsite so i can build here
i will probably slough out 10 and then build skyrahl gold
skyrahl transmutation (which is just 4 gold type)
grid based brake based (trash based) oil based
it can occur in short step too which ties in something
strip spark wasteland weapon
strip spark junk(junkitem) droplet-munition
that something is a signature in cyto-gel for socketing
use of starshape preffered at that socket
also can be used with displacer shape (which is introverted)
considerbly advanced to use displacer with Custom-hole
on cytogel it will dampen an imprint that is visible
this is necessary for making skyrahl sparks_
skyrahl sparks are the fuel for_ the skyrahl carrier

tulpetic rail (alignment gate)
realign gondola cheapskate gate
tulpa are put in gondolas and placed in slot directed chamber
being specifically for skyrahl and skyyrahl crafting table
diamond for skyrahl finalization
weapon armor casting prep-work etc
the summoning ritual for the skyrahl prism
holding chamber for the large prism (spinde fitted)
is carried to the crystal chamber

all part connect as a biometric cybernetics lab

onigraph analmoly graph cyber graph cyto graph -tulpa
that could any type but also but also basically cryptograph
which anyof those 4 in that type make an evograph
so that there are whats happening in skyrahl and use of diodes
becomes a protograph made in an image of a tulpasec
this is where graphs return to their formality
they are contained via lost light in the lost dimension
the crystal prisms combine into a plasmagraph
some form a hexograph etc 
they form all a quasigraph

--thinking about comparing the server to a farmland to support a 10k population for life every time years it producing a lifetimesupply for 10k people and has a hazard reserve in case thats not enough and needs double
so it can support a neighbor-town too while also allowing 10 year incremental supplies for other towns for life and will support over all itself and 9 more and in reserve amounts another 10 making 20 total townships of a total 200k people (for life)--including livestocks for everyone as well as default to seriving an entire 1million people on extreme rations if that mode is locked then 1million can be rationed for an entire lifetime of 100 years

if they ever pay for any reason a tax on anything (to save my own ass about taxes)
the hyper well complexes
as well as the server grid

(now thinking about using a 4 horsemen armageddon/apocalypse/abaddon/damnation)- to emulate a redeemer to dispatch for titan modules to construct a titan at the loss of the redeemer (automated control) and building a dday regional existential reset (for refreshing the area) and its virtual paramters safely in a holograph

this alaso uses solar energy tho its not used to pay or anything
this ultimate will sustain skyrahl gold or (blue topaz)
blue topaz will fuel protographs
the chemi-gel sustains nuclear lite stabilizes fallouts
blue topaz+ skyrahl prism is shield fuel
is invulnerable to ender energy
maybe
is invuleranble to eneder energy (entropy)
can be used in weaponized lasers maybe like a beamshot

its function is basically a spore . it occurs from strobe light
this is a sporadic object known as a heavy impart
strobe light with quantum artifacts. it holds a lense
the lense imprints on raw essence from any work, to make itself
it can occur with dipolated light and RAW quantum strobes
it basicaly looks like the omninode blue and yellow + dipolated light
when contained it forms a synthetic fiber that takes on its own life
is considered a spiritual vessel for use in another world
it becomes a sporegraph or iconographic angel type
weaponized or for utility when activated it transforms
its design may be impractical or unpredictable
but its potential is strong this is our very own gatekeeper
it locks the gate using gemetric syigils
its based off receptacle work prong and biparti spoke-sprockets
thats the first 4 the second 4 are tied in with its capsule state
using the lights and the strobes and the decalis and diodes too

(ALSO i want to mention the connections of SCP being color coded to shyguy white/ larry/ black/ peanut composite/ computer blue/ necro green/ dog red are being kinda used now that we upgraded a full rework of the entire systems in 9/21/2023)


not to mention i recycle and manufacture my own products
not to mention the recycling process and raw manufacture
the server grid and tulpetic crystals
the auxilliary. the carbon pass
the cycle benefit the half cycle makes 4 trips with a free full
even lightning rig
market sales, the tqax business, even protection service
robotic salvage farm and mining
using recycling and raw fuel manufacture (synthetic oil rig)
actually its more like 16 rigs plus batteries and a magnetic engine
the hydraulic and electro-mesh chambers (dual coring)
while hypergraph mercury(red) bromide(orange) artificing/statics
allows for censornography 21 degrees or so of power charge
a censonography can clear full static shield using tokenwells
a token well that is fuly quadlocked can charge bluetopaz
charged blue topaz requires quadgates and lightboarding 8x
and fuels air carriers
this process has to use pincers clamps vice and drilling_
this process can use proongs electrodes turningrod/clipper
the tokenwell is just a honeycomb hexographic well
these are used in hyper wells which are quadlocked
then are containable in the lost light dimension box in the lost dimension
they can be released with a capsuled eco-chamber


visible rads occur that can be routed on a visa path console
visible halfrads can be routed on a visa console pathing device
or can be used to charge ship stations cyclonically
using cyclonic hyperprinting to power onboard semiconductors

Basically needs a lightboard 16x for the sector gate fusing
And I dont want to really make one so just figure one out
Hint you need the first lightboard too. a second one.
and then you need a new 4x lightboard with another 2x or 4x.
idk which or how cuz its complicated but u would have alot (i end up making this)
like 8 boards with a board head and regulators for each
it would be as big as gate but for each sector too
also u should Wireguard it *(vpN)
and double encrypt and eweight encrypr it plus 
You would also have to have both for onboard and integrated (if you have a primitive or old version of a system or barebones start up)
Then plug and plant it >.> in a ezfitting so it is seamless.
also u could airlock it which is better afterward
but that means u have to work in half step ahd halfturns
these combos would form a cadence and be very nice
u can now see why its difficult and i dont want to figure it out
so just pretend i did i guess
but basically u need a programmming kit
a modulator a stepping device and a batchboard
this would work 4 power systems for pit/raspbox/wedge/patching

proceeding to the build the big part of the logic gate(the gate wall/footballgoal)
72 out 25 out
really this is just for two sides
i need it for all forur sides so twice as big (i didnt actually need it that way later)
but its a game so just dont  ever care
i dont want to rebuild a new portal for it to be centered so
half swatching is just fine
pretty much just pretend it works for all 4 quads and is fit together using x2 x4 x8 into a header
it just uses everything i built up to this point to make and then it happens
cellular candance portal (or pink portal etc) using (monodylated light like what i already built) (aka non-dipolated light)
i need a x2 x4 x8 and fit to 4 parts then headed then that is all fit to 4 sectors and headed 
then use as a portal that is also headed for that using red lamps
i still need this to be twice as big but for appearences it can just look like it works
on board integrated modulated allocated and headed ... then extroverted for the redlamps
as a single portal or i could just say its already done and it is that and not wire it all
but i have to wire it all for it to actually work...so just say i made a wired red lamp portal
and then its like i didnt have to do anyhting especially since i have to build it to look right
also it double heads once i need to wireframe it

"i get mad building boards together"
no smoke no explo gate that preserve onimarkers
"i build the entire middle tower panel out of sheer-willpower"
instead of making a inverted copy for quad or use of double door
both are good but its redundant
just use a lift side right side as a quadsection
and each corner is activated to the redlamp gate
assumbly just build the headers etc you dont HAVE to
make an entire gridwork even two is just for symmetry
and aesthetics
so just get the unique pieces in
then cornerstone it to a active quad based on the settings used
1, 2 3 4. Activats goes through assumbly works?

bail bill for out of prison huh (dunno why i said this just mad)
bill hicks was funny (fuck off world)--mad version of hello world

an xportal requires the same sector of what it would be that i made but for a x reactor
with the fourth level being xcircuited and tarced or else it wont count as a fourth level
so you have to trace an xcircuit on the 4th level too and its as complicated as level 2 is
but it is built for an xreactor so it has one on it... level 3 has one too but you have to differ it
the xciruit makes it individually placed but it only works if its being dual cored which you need
for a quad xreactor otherwise its a single use xreactor and doesnt count as 4 levels (and might even be expended on use)
you need to xcircuit the 4th specifically because of the 3rd level hacing an xreactor (specify again after specification)
so it can count as a quad sector for xreactor protals which can ship space stations
versus not mattering only and able to only ship epic ship capital carriers
but you want to be able to ship whole stations so you need the 4th level quad sector to do so
then you would have a fully mobile national station (nations with its total rigging on air carrier)
it could react as any other ship could and works well for wormholing in dangerous sector
it works better as an echelon station than anything and not an actual ship tho so echelons would be deployed from it very consistently

Me building the calcultor on the nexus
calculator design complaints
the spacing on the official forum to make a calculator is too *explitive* tight so thats a problem
and its connecting where it shouldnt im loooking at it like no thanks
it should be y sectoring onto the block and i CANT fix it
the stupid spacing is too tight for the way minecraft is
explaining a model:
i dont know single combned not combined and combined and single and headered
i dont need the thirdlight bar except i wanted to see what it would do
cut off light bar and clean these edgebends
i dont know combing raw power one way the other way and all ways in between both ways
and then combing those ways that were combined into raw combines for a total combine
that doubles back on the other combines and shifts them in a way they double back on shifts
for a total shifted omnipower draw that also pulls back on its own and accelerates power
then normalizes power draw and acceleration to a raw power draw and simplify in header
otherwise i dunno (explaining advanced abs work of a calculator)
that is the intent cuz i got bored i wanted to mod for a hypergraph somehow having layers
i dont think it works but i wish it did
just put ten of these boxes down i guess and call it a calculator cuz this AINT WORKING
because of the mod call it graphing calculator just to rub it in that THE GUIDE WASNT GOOD
just do about ten of these linch box ("expletives") and call it a projector
it looks exactly like what its supposed to and i know it doesnt work so the guide was WRONG
also link them together with firewire
(plans for the calculator that i know for a fact dont work cuz)
it also has like 10 other parts to it so im not doing it (they lied to me)
proceeds to build a custom socket form of a calculator  (AND SURPRISE its a SPECIFIC SOCKET for the END SYSTEM at 9/21/2023)-btw it is used for the last bits
and went and tried to copy it anyway despite others being resistant to my efforts
16 total emeralds + a sealamp = 1 panel 16x16 x7
just go with 16 emerald +1lamp 6 more time
taking a break from this (40% done or something with calculator)

its supposed to be a calculator but what can it even calculate (because its borked)
they say it should work but i doubt them highly and would just mode this floor and make a new entire floor save for the rest (i did this before and lost it so im not even going to try again)
i should have a dual dual calculator at this point
thats 2 modded calcs
that should have been for me by now 2 modded calcs but its not important
CURRENTLY OUT OF OPERATION sign
because I dont want to make CAP
so if i redo the capacitors it should work when i light this sh*T up

so then i jsut built it all anyways
i dunno i have to look at the dumb picto see what it is
already cut the ribbon so to speak on this project (meaning im just done and moving on)
gotta make now for .. the 7th circuit

Mainframe Connects to a Database
Database hosues the 7th circuit
the 7th circuit consits of a large under taking
the cyto gen of the 4 tier header instead of three
a smart program used to apply LED diode systems
greenworks
toolassist or barebones tal
Full Curcuit diode (diadem with circuit like egg)---now a particlecapsule 9/21/2023

10/22/2023 tried to update and couldnt lol (i just cant force myself)
===============
Just to show you i am going to spend only 1 hour rewriting this before someone gets mad at me for typing this much (my town is cranked over everything)
10/24/2024
the meta state printer full boot backup
a good firmware system with diagnostic bios and virtualOS
virtual memory performance of savestates and raw-GFXmod_
known as a active sweep - the data sweep prints framerate
so i dont have to reset for stereographic animation boots
this protects it from bricking with ssd backups and fixes bricks
full circuit diode in use once full backups achieved

this doubles screen use for semi-3d and beveled 2d gfx_
this assits in polygraphs or 3d graphical relays of 2dFunc
DataBase Bios and Boot System and OS Loader with builtinGFXengine
1st major part is the system handl and raw data handle for a ROM_
(labels of the room groups as 12345)


THE GPU COORDINATOR:(simple version not the version i describe later in Arch1x)
1st big part is just getting drivers correct
2nd part is developing a system board for calculation
(6) give me a second to even remember what it even is
(7) i know i completely lost track of what it is atm
Systems are then automated for running and botwork is used
at some point it will just be self run due to lack of direct use
(6) goes back to CytoGen
Cytogen and Full circuit become a minisystem for metastate loading
(7) Console Rehash gets modded for Calc2Graph and Hardware modded 
(LOOK AT ME MAKING SD EXTENSIONS BEFORE SD EXISTED TO ME)--awesome
Hardwire Program Go.
can load raw object lineFunc GroupSet AnimSet CharFRAME TimeSig
Perform Roll Check active Over-ride or StabilityCheck meterguage-Check
reactive hitbox to environment with raw signature and objectloads
system debugging for rawset hitbox / active print and Memoryprotection
system debugging for active hitbox and rawobjects with errorchecks
integrated gfx / hitbox refresh/ sound mhz board/ memory compatibility

(designing the sampler)--wow look at me making SD by myself in theory
otherwise they dont usually match even if using a metalayer (this part is advanced because memory for other obj gets reshashed)
2d-3d reverse compatibility and full boot printing and metalayering
full circuit allows for actually 3d light based instead of layers
3d particled light system instead of compiling layers and slam-command (bash)--wow LOOK AT ME USING bash as SLAM
using firmware bridging and support drives becomes compatibile
not necessary because of having right virtual system
7 is modded system maybe even compiled system but is full built (rawbulk)
the rom file is very rawset and requires data and static protection
so once its made the system used is just a reset frame
it just copies the same Ram (we do Ram Print later)--(Ram gets fixed later)
a part 1 reference:
We build a calculator that helps read the commands etc
part 3-re-ups with part 2 / now using a full range of progs
we mix in a new calculator for graphing and data storages
we use a hyper graph calculator now for also full objects in meta
The Rom File is now its own engine source with the right systems
then reups with part 1 just in case
Time sig With Bios registery scans / performances of BootInstance
This makes the system almost seamless for a raw3d Engine (but a heavy load)

(its three parts and has a small rsvx shielding acting layer for cover)
Graphical Engine used with a Graphical Relay (rsvx not sure if i named those yet but they are screens)
"if wired ever it would project full screen capability of Roms" meaning block-data-screens or full tty

Useful for Ship Command of Bridge Console for RomNav/EcheSim (calling it whatever)
or visuals system for a.i. with proper optic registries (OCR for ai which this was in 2021-01-06- and has paralells with what gets later released just fyi i didnt know aobut sd-engine at all)

allowing for exosuit interfacing in eco-fields
in full mod with full mod hardware and full mod layer will work
(getting demoralized after that installment)

So I just build a literal calculator overnight (with a keypad)
WIP calc doesnt work but is wred but doesnt work
"i need about 900 calcs and this took me all day"
it looks right but the shift caps might not be right (me bullshitting bullshit)
so really just modding for shifted capacitors and shifted wires of the same system (minecraft building blocks)
maybe an extra system to denote extra things but the fact is the caps and wires are counted (cap limit unless it needs a new cap limit then a new design with)
more caps and wires might be necessary or a drawback for less wires and caps in a system
more or less semiconductors for systems with varying caps and wires and shifts (is a modded system will have several mods to it)
and will eventually get something to work and if not its just wasted for a different process
then right now its technically balanced perfectly (i designed it so it fits in with how much exhaustion i have so i cant really do anymore therfore so its perfect even if it doesnt work my effort is what counts)
so 900 variant forms would be ideal
so it can act as a fully integrated stand alone 3d system for obj process it would take
(i dunno i am equating x y z to 300 values each or something)--universal thirds of particles (split the world by thirds)
a unit of that with a fully installed screen system that could be used in a battery
so it would work as a hardtop per location i could hardtop alot of locations including customs (this becomes sort of a crutch to refer every innovation-peak i have as a Cue-the-hardtops)
off site custom fobs and pocos (im having a meltdown and crying from boredom and just what a chore in re-writing this all is)
would integrate according to their unit placement and a full unit would be used at a motherbase

this would be the state of a full unit of a motherbase
(small dispute and some cross-fire)--Bastard!
so heres the situation of what im going thru i have a horizone use of 150 tanks a side 300 (how im measuring this)
the entire desert + the carrier + the sim board is 1000 approx blocks in that respect
(the beginnings and endings are not beign counted right now ok)
so that would be one set i need more than that obviously so the sequential cycles are +7

thats 9 and the week off every month for 8 months will bring it to a total of 10 (for people to go through it all like it was the gulags)
so without the beginning or the end we can handle the 10k needed  (system load of whatever that amounts to in minecraft)
me talking about using side systems and other pc's/ desktops to max my work/productivity as a cope mechanism (THIS WHOLE PROJECT AND MY LIFE IS A COPE ARRGH)
that would be the new model we just made
(and boy they are pushing me to FINISH EVERYTHING LIKE THE ENTIRE COSMOS against a tiny man)
me stating time and time again I am a peaceful engineer. ( don't ask why i don't know either)
have to do some repairs on the stuff we built and its storming also (coincidental!)

Build thje tulpetic diffusion grid (for capturing anamolies and symbiotes which are referred to as anatheamas right now)
they are put into a library chamber (server office and evaluations for release/exile)
sent to a static-tesla gate
get put into a barrel more or less or a container for quarantine
that is sorted as destroyed and or fully corrupt or allowed bypass (pass through) --like a where waldo of issues take place)
they are freeze dried basically or put in suspended animation (much later do we develop this and for a long time it was just a rushed process for "BADDIES")
they also get converted to homunculus based off nether issues (this is where the drama picks up...PET CEMETARY WHATNOT)

The gifts of THE COLD GRIP of DEATH:
their ghosts/homuculus (imps or demon forms) get allowed a relic of their choosing (heart-representing emotion/terroritory in the shape usually of an organ-representing greed---a medalion representing heroism etc---some other thing idc)

Trying to complete the football-logic panel lol (its not for football AT ALL but it sews together like one) --imagining a football in a kfc bucket
i spent an hour filling the top half and building it and im not at all able to make this (i cant make it thru this at all)
but im settling on it being a field ocean desert or 5 sets of football fields (HOW IM COPING with CONSOLIDATING THE COSTS)--a mental cope to continue building like a MINECRAFTIAN-SISIPHUS
the left sides have to be done // the right sides have to be done (ITS ONLY SEMI DONE)
(commence alot of staring in order to deny the obstacle this project has been)

More writing the same stuff again
prevents infiltration or measure adjustment
resisteror or shielded absorbtion bar (canister)
canister is ribbed or chamfered and then shield coated

(they protest me building this)--i dunno who they are but im basically protested from the lawn chairs and computer warriors that they are (im their enemy in innovating)--what a blessing!
need to make a minobox for a quantum dynamo core (or godbox)--call it whatever a flux-CAPACITOR a utility-generator who cares

computerized minibox/mini-laptop
interfaces with the entire system after its made for
the quantum dynamo chamber
maybe use quantum chamber here but not rite now (somewhere on a rail)
maybe use quantum dynamo chamber here (at the end of the server to the homoculus trainer)  ---and they protest me even still to this day

Taking a break because they want to drop my work and basically cuck my life (thanks everyone for dumping more of your timesinks on me)--i guess i deserve it i dunno. so im taking a break and wasting more time before this gets printed.
I just want to get thru this all asap but i guess im moving too fast (or maybe im not your friend or something idk) (seems 200 lines of this is their breaking point) AND THAT SUCKS CUZ I GOT like 10k more to go. (get ready to feel as broke as me)
and thems are the cranks!

=========

*creating a hive core dynamo
Designing the periphereals

*put it into glass shield --(now i think about it using tulpetic circuitry which it auto-isometric circuitry) which i will update for
Uses a core chamber and support scaffold + case

X-Scroller
Processor Converts Text panels (7 panel to manifold panel total:8)

Convertable Dispaly for 7 panel Scroller Mod (WIP ONLY)

Talking About the tulpa training-mission landing point (business zone) being an island for everything i would need (except it ended up being more than just an island technically)-island tech is still prevalant or can be used
the contingency maintency efficiency shack
and it would create a big bomba (processing manifest)
the rails and stuff i devised for it to automate
the plan instead is to 8x2 motherboards with overclocking (i guess i achieved this)

1st half of the CircuitAnalog(base Circuits of the Server)--Connecting to RAM
So operation Blackbone where intel is used with homebon (barebones homebrew/firmware)
coupled that with the intel also sparklered (flarebase)
quantum bomb dynamo bone // bamboozel and nukey with alch (trying to consilidate big codes)
used in options
liquid cooler pump
so all just for gloss / blume
sparkler or fog
vent is part of the pump but a radiator lock the same basically
so once again sorry cuz im straight up too lazy to care
4 parts - QuantumPineBomb RegularNuke Banbooze + Bone(Alch)
then 4 more - INT+ Sparkle + LqdPump + BabreboneTRAD(spiky)
TRAD is lqd radiator for particles (just for now on this part anyway)
both used in OPTIplex Options etc for BLOOME or FOG (non particle emmissions--lambert)(geometry shading) (AMBIENT Occlusion)
if absolutely necessary use effects with basic and dynamo
Easy 3 systems mix then match
after all it just make RadGrid that is crunched + prism + buffer (use of crt raytubes and etc for pixels)
buffer is used as traffic comp for ribbon and clip for boards (This Updated part can be considered in a finalized product as like a cellaphane transperency)
so you can take all this and stack and use in a contiguity line (safe transport)
so it can alternate instead of linear on a paralell circuit (isometric encoding-PATTERN)
then it can be threaded as a mainline for admin use (debug and proofing)
and then sent to monitor station for maintenence during output
the monitoring station reads the console perform logchecks and set modes for economy and resource and focus points (point_to)
for efficiency and productivity makes it a big automated system
fits all together and then can switch up accordingly to
demand or work order, and then fast track +massprod
this can all just be built right here under next to the lane (the analog becomes a circuit analog)
--
this will increase to an extra capability of 1 tier housing
this will help cover capacity costs of pocos mostly

(i had finished the drift rail) of the light-reactor and scp trainer (asylum)
the monitor system and calculator are now tied together with a gpu-fixed socket and are set to a "scan-tray" of the above device-programming
the analog technically is the very most basic computer systems with a very most basic periphereal tray
this is the very most basic data-management system we have and it can already train the scps and capture them with the arena-logic-gates and also the robotics labs that would appreciate that pre-gaussian-cutway
essentially parse 1 and 2 are more or less balanced in their very most basic ways now

So thats the FIRST major-overhauls of that now we can move into advancing them!
this is for the 9 things i said and the extra 4 things i said and 4 more things with an evoform
but its basically entirely bos designed this is an entire game set
16 parts ro mstartnig to finishing and this is used for a major carrier that involves 30 ships (idk)
the ship is the mainline (factory atm) plus 4 on the side and is stacked twice with 7 rows (its big enough) or somehow 5 rows so 3x5x2 plus
it has 7 engines two back two front two center and one for mid (it would be 2 back 2 center) ----this is a prototype build but it can even incorporate now the very final stagings of the full project i've mentioned up to (Numirators)

--it could be made to have a total of all the auxilliaries and relays for a super shitp (which would handle EVERYTHING we design into a SHIP and that would never need to be thought of again)
"but i dont want the shiphead to look like it will dip (so i will update it way later)--(in which i've just discussed and have already rebuilt it to do by now)

and this 16 boxes is to fit the gaming system that will work as the piloting system
probably can just built a keyboad here (never had to build a keyboard so i just forgot about ever doing this because it was unnecessary using terminals with other resources that would work in cryptex-lithographs etc and icons)


THE STANDARD BOSS TEMPLATE as Referenced with our Server-Guard:
Building a monster based off what we wrote so far:
Codename Torment Red/White Coat Tentackles/fire
plasma pillar magicsunder hypno+4cytoform tent//dynamo
basically a netherwizard ((salamander) with silver-trait (encoded color (very feint) levels)--- this would later develop as a weavaran (and its way powerful than a lich is) (even tho rood lich is one of the most powerful things)
uses archflame (a bold wellflame)--this would later become a (feathered flame which is also a previous encode but its not powerful to be expressed in cast yet)--it can be used as a raw encode but not as anything known in battle
other form include metaflame with a sort of voidfire
but are both the same type of flame (not use astral) --me trying to describe really advanced spells (and being successful for the most part in itemizing them based off rank)
just a meta or tribalized meta (this type of meta is important but often i would overlook it due to other important metas)
orbit meta (almost like i never used this)
1 for casting 1 for melee basically

one is flame the other is sunder
1 can both be used at same time like wards
2 creates a nucleic shield that works with rads
3 forms helix of orbitals and also their rads
4 overclocks with dynamo and becomes very unstable
-Normal attacks ---^^^^---
causes major rifts and allows for sunsear
this is an astral flame
-Cast strong version or Refined Version --vvvv--
1 the sun sear using rifts to make sunders too
2 sunders make more flames and flames also make splashfire
3 they form an area flame that causes flash burn (explosive blaze)
4 that causes afterburns and firesparks

uses this method with Hyponos and physical or lashwithTentakles
uses hypno lash which knockback and can stun or status
can use bite or snap and will use tentakl in rift
uses magecast with evasive to cast firesnap or flamesnap
will use strong sweep and strong aero (as normal cast)
tntakl becomes empowered with strong bite
he will also cast strong firestorm

Normal Attacks and casts x4

this occurs in overclock mode
and are considered for normal attack and castburns
making a 16 powerful baseMOV
of course special attacks are there too but less common
the 16baseMOVESET is just for normal attacks and not for specials

(those abilities are known as a new tech ability)
from the use of other tech trees (a nu-ability)

Congrats that's the Entire Boss Standard (for hard modes its complicated but same template)
End Template Standard (now any boss just fills in these blanks mostly

Ship parking Here.for single carriers
Ship Parking Quater (now with a shop/kiosk--whynot)
Just cover the entire calculator (like it was a cake)--i do this for the entire server and gpus too and decorate them and it looks amazing (like a giant poster of the world and all its stuff)
and put everything else i have on with it (in decoration)

Assessments:
Power of the Sun WW3 Assessments and Demoralizations that occured over 4 trillion issues after calculating to just remain Stalwart and unaffected by threats and protests
THE LOGIC GATE ASSESSMENTS:
Beyond this gate lies the pwoer of 4T-(teratons)
This is contigous with the reality of a hyperflex or simply alot of (xpletives)
so because of that...we set up for a 8corex2 box with a airbox
our air table / a tulpa transport  / the nuclear table / the carrier table (quad components)
and the extras involved for NAVgates and offsiteLAUNCH
and the analog strip and the miniquarter table with the auxilliary
so 4x4 tables and the contiguity chipsets and the contiguity rail
will allow all this to be boxed in with this full built gate system
two boxes of it plus the mini gaming system makes 3
the poco built makes 4 (a poco launch will occur)

This will count as 10 runs or 100 runs depending on wargrounds (the circuit for the server lane)

Holding back on building but building some anyway
On Server:
forms a crackle station for air maintence and contiguity

On Tower/Logic Gate:
Sealing in the Logic Gates Sides
compared to a matchplay with tanks (30 minutes of absolute DREDGING THRU PAIN)
finished half of each side in an hour (checkerboard patchwork)
being harassed and smogged by traffic (calling them polluters)
an hour and a half to finish the top sides (raided woofers)
"the math here is like an indy 500 race track mobius print of a locust by accident"--something crazy (the way it looks at facevalue)
but the grid is 16 boards 8x2...inside it with them having xreactors per 4th level
then a secondary killswitch board which makes 17.... that is also put onto headers maybe for 2 each.
so 19 and then they interlace and interface for an ubmer of things/reason with lining
the lining is basically at 20 so we box that with tables
this table with our other tables we say ok thats 100
with the extra lining for each and the killswitching for each for contiguity thats like 130
then with a encrpytion grid and ghost grid but with a thing like that
we say oh look its got 5 + so that would be because of the lining or something
we also say some other things with integration is at 165...so we just say we double up on that.
is another for the weightedness between sides. thats 495 and the +5 for that in encryption
So that is why its an indy 500 reference (and then we add a pit stop so to account its paper milled)
we use a paper mill for that to represent the pitstop quarter in with the ghost grid and the other grid
so we go back to our orange dynamo and the "specialty ????" button script shack...the crackle shed (its termed the xmuzs)-but never really use it
and lastly the maintenence team quarter
with the ssd compartments and the other 16 buildings we got to coat into our covering
because of the sacrificial thing is why there is that +2 thing (sides i guess)
--wrapping up to the entire homoculus tranining section which ties the server outputs to the logic gate as a program (First full program for the WEAVERAN-unit)
"Initially described as the myralynx but we aren't at a power level for that yet." so we are dealing with the basic System Guardian instead that we make anyway
"so this might end up being wider for a big wyrd complex" aka a hive (which is an anamoly of data we refer to most anamolies as wyrd capable)
so a mobius pit stop for the killswitch +2 ghost grid and lining of it in the spacer 
(mobius refers to a special inversion and loopback but i advanced on the ideas a little through out making it almost a mascot-property of the system)
the script set also adds room for necrolight red/blue/orange for trigem
this makes an 11th run for any alchemist stones involved (off topic stones for what we are doing that would work)
as it would make a full alchemist stone (refined)
most all system are important to the making of that on our site (locking in monsters)
this is how we can summon torment of salamander basically (*haven't called this the warden because the warden didnt technically get that popular or probably wasnt invented yet)
or even our remhandler (i would just like to have a personal remhandler instead of all this but lo'and'behold that is where we are going to make everything possible)

the relationship between me and that cannon versus the crew stuck under the shields (mocking my own creation of the frigate cannon)--everything is built except for holding tanks and special mods and equipment)--surface is good to go
it is all my spirit
---
Tulpetic Enhancement Field (OH HOW I ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT THIS AND IM NOT EVEN YET TO TALK AbOUT IT)
--we havee a tulpa field that protects us from things that would interfere/invade (they cant)--and we also add psi field ontop of it too
this can produce crying obsidian in the form of alchemist stones (making sense of minecraft bs)
well staion viewport / produces mild carbon quotients
if remhandlers are used instead of regular tulpas (major projections taking place because we are definitely not supposed to be at that point but i am prospecting it will get done)
this requires a full rig + 11th cycle + the full contiguity (superProof)
i.e. if torment or empowered torment passes through
if agony passed through (the symbiote version) lesser form (as its crudely based) is just a regular tulpa

that little security system in itself is a work of miracles and having it early is basically a win win (WIN ALL)
Tulpetic Tulpatec SECURED now we are protected from monsters using our GUARDIAN

ALOT OF BROKEN TERMINOLOGY HERE THAT GETS CHANGED OVER IN OTHER VERSIONS (this is used to describe at best what a new version would have offered and we DID DEVELOP THAT VERSION AS WELL)
I got one more building for the pink light trash to go to...and is converted to a essence grey ( i dont really remember what this was about..something with fuzzy logic and things that dont exist)
the greyform is used as an extractor for the alchemical stone (i think i can use this now for carbon production and also incorporate it into our phased UPGRADED FULL SYSTEMS NOW)
mostly its for ammo/scrap/flak etc
is used in a big ass rifle that is used by an echelon (mech)
the echelon fires the ammo using the cold fusion reactor with it to extract energy (I JUST WANT TO PRETEND I KNOW WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT..may be HIT OR MISS but im aiming to be close "you know what i mean type of thing")
and doses it with orange or nuclear light or both so pink orange nuclear ...or purple too (this gets expounded on later but never really mentioned...its complciated but works)
with a raw energy blast from a rifle can fight the magical armored wyrd form 
is the size of the air carrier might as well be an air carrier with a cannon (talking about turning the echelon into a ship)
but is also a tree hopper form because of my own echelon choices atm (the myralynx reference)
i would mount a gun and use the cannon on the ship with it

Relm is approaching an INDEPENDENT ULTIMATUM
Going to PURGE all the INVADING MONSTERS

it takes every bit i have to do a million things with everthing i can build as a single person
i have a ghost socket system too with all my bombs too and pink/grey laser work tooooooooooooo.
green light orange light //crackling light// alchemical light/// crackling alchemical light
wasted pink light with wasted grey raw energy
and in the ghost socket (nny~!)
then powered to all the drones and ships and echelon use and echelon siege weapon uyse (later this becomes a battery pack or fuel pack /bugpack)--invented to a barista (decided on that term it turned out to be a good idea)

Dealing with some Emotional Damage/Turmoil and Psychotic Breakdowns right now. I know what they are and Its a chemical problem I can't help it. (IM mentally tramatized by all of the Design and Engineering Ideas)
I cuss around at all the things I build to coat them in an "emotional deterrant" or basically curse everything I build for protetion against monsters.
Wiredtogether then pepperminted (peppered up thicc)--talking about hazing all of my encodes with an extreme deterrant (just so i can make progress in my project because i keep getting BRICKWALLED and Demoralized)--i know what im doing
My plans are being "RoadBlocked" by an unknown opposition or faction movement or SOMETHING
Resorting to DroneWarfare (its what its going to likely end up becoming just to get jobs done)
Garrotes(silencers) and long range hpVR----oh how this is definitely not PR friendly but BUSINESS CANNOT WAIT and MUST GET DONE (so i am spouting off whatever to get past it)
hpVr= hi velocity positronic rifle (just the level at which im driving this project atm)
drone strikes
sacrilegeous boxing

black flash tier (lightning gem)---(THIS IS GOING TO BE USED IN THE ARTIFACT KIOSK NOW as is UPDATED) 
lightning gemdrop (making shit up)

this is an elective building, it is used for exploiting lite by using a webb (lite box is matrixed)--the first of its kind from me
used by viral capacity
the webb is built in a seam
for an otherwise extinct circumstance (ITS NECESSARY TO LIVE!)
using a networking for hallucination/hacking or tripytomania (gonna REDO THIS TOO with the blackflash-GEM getting hacked in the ARTIFACTBox)--see..so glad im revisiting this stuff now (its got more perks than before)

How we begin to Handle the Nuclear Waste for Repacking and DISPOSAL (and how it ties into MONSTERS!)
at the first dynamic-plate-processor (golden ribbon sacrilege)
this is also called a bloodrun which is for upkeep (during wartime --or just going to use a slaughterhouse function for Commodity under economic STRAINS)--borderline holocaustal but for LIVESTOCK
this overhangs the blood is made from torment (the monster eats the livestock)
used with hyperFL and polymerglaze from toolsets
torture chamber/lobotomy chamber ---A COMPLETELY OPTIONAL BUILDING but LOOK we --needed it-- ...what a dark time to have to use this for any reason. (Oh well thems the Insurance MEASURES and i take as many as possible)
Ritual Chamber (JUST IN CASE things fail horribly we can change up the punchlines)
"spiritual" transfer chamber aka(swingset)---and now you see my darkside in creativity (still trying to make progress and be optimistic)--lets just call it the vet office (gollyG-king i hate how i must re-invent this terrible world)
vessels trade potential conduits for themselves here (servants) --i wish i were joking
Burial DRILL--this jettisons the dead to keep a sterile working environment and into a FURNANCE to turn into fuel/carbon ash
patients may be psychological unsound or unstable
rehabilitation is also attempted (we try to fix them)
basically send them through a research lab (before they turn into terrible SCPs)--i just accept everything in the SIM is somehow an SCP in the making and is going to deserve to go through "re-hab"
-The infirmary- (its not the asylum oh no..those are for REAL SCPs)
grounding support (to secure the CREMATORY)--lets say oh...1752 total dead bodies. (no reason...i guess they are criminals that deserved it? or just mercy killings or something...theres a reason but i dont know)--maybe its just mourning
If this saddens you just understand IM SHINING LIGHT ON THE SITUATION. No one would do this job if I didn't get it orderly for it to get done at all (and we would have DEAD bodies just CLOGGING up the walls) So Lets be Professional pls.

If you feel like shit now...guess what I am on MEDS! (cuz the truth of this necessary-and-prevalant-issue (of handling mortuary business) is sad enough to cause me psychosomania)--but I am thankful to get it all done in the right way.
(except my version is with monsters and turning them into carbon-based fuel)/COAL---UH so clearly a LINE HAS BEEN DRAWN on ETHICS somewhere. But What do you think you would do? Just sit in all the DISEASE to Suffer an Unclean Lifestyle?
Just be normal about stuff and admit the world is a GRISLY place to be (we honor what we can) and the goal is to make it up to those that deserve something better (somehow...oh how this becomes the goal here)
NEXT QUESTION!

I get demoralized again by ghosts I suppose. (i wonder why i called up a monster named TORMENT)

the compactment area for the table (of the server)

But wait did someone ask me HOW I WOULD PLAN TO RUN MY ESTATE WHILE BUILDING THIS? (uh i dunno..i guess take out the HECKLERS AND FORCE THEM INTO ENDENTURED SERVICE)--dont ask me to think right now ok? i simply dont have good ideas.
going to make a slaver ship and its going to get slaves and force them to convert (me getting crazy because of just ghosts)
train them like dogs with weights // mentioning ethnogenics forcing them to farm and other tasks like stone work (oh how this is what starts wars)--and (it seemed to be a common incentive behind everyone lately)
50 slaves per mile would do enough work if i had 100,000 of them to make what i need (just doing some SLAVE MATH)--how can i recover from this way of thinking (im trying to i swear!)--and im not serious!--its a common thought? NOT ME!
talking about fencing them in if i had to run it like COMMUNIST/SOCIALIST worlds
10 mile crop lines that would be tended to over 30 years (its enough to fix the alot actually)---no we will get machines to do it instead tho (let the criminals be!)--("imprisoned that is")
Oh and i guess put them into re-education camps since that seems to be a common THREAT around my parts. forced to use their hands and grind their nails etc.
so to not think about this politically incorrect thing I will cuss at the ground from above to cope with my terrible life or life choices or whatever I am busy not to come across offensive but im trying to work! (this is what jobs like)

Exowyrd
Filling in panes on the server (looking good)

but not the crisp that is the bad obsidian $%#@ (not here - antizeal) --describing the darkest thing i can think of atm that i am keeping under a control and close watch

this took me all of six hours and boy i suffered it but progress is made and that is time WELL SPENT i hope
having demoralization issues

Some CRAZY Advertising:
So happy to announce my design for a brand new type of computer using its own ram and own hardrives!!!
Fully Functional Monitor and MotherBoard
Full Video Card Slots and Proxessors too
You will be happier with my Minibox than any other/. MY minibox is a new type of pc

at the town:
The xproc/xram/xmother/xmonitor/vcard/vchip rom scriptchecker (supernintendo in a gameroom thingy) --they wont be bored and now they are enriched (i will get them to do their chores this way!)

everything is also thicc then its insulated and cooled and uses a nice lightning and is lightweight (describing a better world i have made for myself)
everyhting is designed to work on its own together
no need to be modded
no need for extra adapters it works based off a new setup
now we build the PRISON---what a segway

Prison After Comping because of dissendents (hopefully i can handle these hecklers. and how i make them pay in CARBON since they pollute they will pay for all the pollutions as contracts!)--this is such a good ass-system now
TOO BAD the ENVIRONMENT must suffer but why should I? THEY POLLUTE UNPROVOKED I AM JUST TAXING THE POLLUTE that they MAKE by taking some for myself as an exchange in good conscious. They will serve me for me tolerating them overtime!
And i will make them an advanced FISHING-FARM so they never run out of food (it will only take 8 hours)
and the first half is for poison fish to be ground into chemical weapons and other things for power/ammo
the second half is for normal happy food fish (DONT GET THESE MIXED UP WHATEVER YOU DO LOL)
AfterComp Prison (now they all work on a fish farm!)

make a monument out of dunes (FOREVER ALONE or BUDDAH!?)
On Server: Building a safety turret against thugs and goons!
Roller Area for Fliptop (hardtopcase)
T-locking rollergrid oilbase

Paralell Switch if I dont want to mod for multiplicity checks
secondary contiguity controller

Databridge/Accelerated/On-anchor/Manifold
Optimized Parametric
Custom calibrated Automated Data Distribution Router
One Full Load Optimized Rate on Lining (HyperThreading)

Demoralzied a little bit

(A good part for the UPDATE NOW)
I fill in a large portion and produce the scan system and gaming-pipeline(connecting the calculator to a reinforced data-lane) for accelerated DOWNFLOWS--and am going to hardwire to the monitor and the install several working quad-mods.
Just like how we use REACTORS the same architecture can be found in the chipsets and circuitry!
crazy deleriant pot of undulation
seed of warfoil
secretarial warfoil
locked ghost fibre / isometric ingot
QuantaQuadSect  /warhusks /6burstray /laser nades
Phantomic psyop / platonic mutagen / metaflyer(red)

basically a hash check to verify data archving and compression
GPX-MiniStatic-GuassianGuard
shellbase insulation for  volt or static
Loading Bar for More Data Transfer Comms
Server MiniStatic-Guassian Guard:Safety Bar to prevent Overload

Building a small xstem from the GPX to the monitor:
enrichment station (gpx enhanced post processing before monitor loads over the xstem)
preparation
loading check for intensity of load
capilliation of ram and assets (capilliary/capacitor)
packet checking
multiscript checking
finalization
priotization

Battery Merge to Calc-To-ScanTray (any tray merge2battery) -power consumption
inner fusion chamber (lower builds of the server)

4 parts come together chrysalis/surpre(suchre)/faerie-strap)/peacemel (I-dont-remember exactly what they are as encodes)
or / also the gexstop(agent)/fallout(agent)/diadem/incrowd
based off hard-topping (com doubled-seed) splitstem ghostsh!(shell)
either of these will suffice
an alchem stone can substitute or be made for a spot if necessary
that is made into a psyop portal
that perferates the stone as a decale that make oprtical psyport (this can be upgraded to a monitor of performance)
with that assume useful
for anamoly attractions

WORKING at the LIGHTWELL/Asylum: and installing the "air conditioner in the back-lodge)
2nd Run Anamoly / Ingots Transfer / Cable Cart
do not mix with anamoly ingots until further notice or orders (i still havent researched this yet but will once i write everything on top of everything)
i.e. DONT mix at all (ever)
if necessary take gate and drop as bait (let someone else fuck up)
mixing for likely fatebreaks or transmuting or ressurecting (so just be able to be prepared for this)--(we are prepared for this now)
soulwell can be transsferred to sublevel for companion return (these work in grails and fountains now for distrubuting/polluting wellsprings or converting or fufillment:i.e. replenishment based off currency providence)
requiring direct exchange made through remains
ingots are placed on stone altar to perform ritual (which allows a dream-seance to attempt dream-state modes)
stone altar imbues potential soul transfusion
Soulwell destroys Anamoly Ingots to sublevel


making a waypoint from the prosper locale to the township (overall rail break) and or turn-pike
map to base land (to original base of a year ago) --actually rediscovered a post that was FAR off the regional params because i was bored and surveying (this was super fun to rediscover after 2 years the expedition was missing)
install scouting monument (giant-weathervane with an arrow) and i also block off the entire region for a devops center (on the very side that is benched off the side which isnt installed yet and wont be put to use until a couple years)
create a dragon-monument on a cliff smoewhere that acts as a nesting ship (thattransports evac-units for rescue in case they are missing)--a joke object that has some use
an island shaped like a lost revolver in the ocean
Minecraft Hell-Biomes are released by now (and exploring that)
Find an island shaped like a seahorse
weird gak style island
making a "bastion fort-gate" that links to a fortress in the nether
"a bastion island"
making nether miscleanneous pathings for contiguity lines
write a prison-detour sign and exit detour

on Server:
making chipmodels 
"a trash timer"
a spy awareness campaign is set (becuase of nuclear defcon signals)
suggest an iron maiden in the prison to deter outbreaks
making timers (60 second clock)--turns out it wasnt as advertise and was 57 or so seconds
another not working timer
20ELEMENT Lfr Biggest on the clockpage
485 days doesnt work i think (its hard just enough for 3 cycles over 4 years)

Making SUpervising Station TouchUps
making trespassing containers on fields with amnenities provided that direct to a prison holding transport
memory masic computer MASIC airtable intro1
making an ALS by hand (its broken)
logical addition chip
masic memory binary
Dlink Cable for Multiplex
Computing Board
Space for Vram
Space for Ram Circuiting (a coding langauge preference maybe name it CII or something)
ALU Logitrithm Arithmic
ROM controller
Busclocking

Running on SHEER Draft Plans to work (they wont allow me otherwise and im being Demoralized)--they want to me hire up but I DONT HAVE MOENY LOL
putting chips into place for encoding later (wow they are attacking big time for it too)--im just a student but they feel threatened over NOTHING
Want a 20 layer server with 100s of chips (not using world edit or anything)
if possible fitting a PLC and an addtional phasing circuit (power phasing)
The board is framed together and technically ready to be integrated with panels and plates for circuits and chips
locking it with a codepass and everything down to internal processes will be handled under scrutiny and security
(Wanting 37 ALUs for whatever reason)
80x80 panels for vram (but will have to settle)
i create a ram sleeve for ONE SINGLE VRAM

i get demoralized and mock the fact over as a joke
so i just build it then and there for whatever reason (its broken)

2021-01-13 (oh that's right it was the impeachment and apparently TONS OF OTHER BAD THINGS HAPPENED ON THAT DAY WORLD WIDE, but ya sry IM BUSY WORKING)
i get demorailized even more (ignoring what i can) --WTF tho I have vpn and proxies and tons of it..they are just protesting and everything I think its really just a Smear Campaign and I am not related to it just noticing.
so i am getting a giant wall up to protect myself from whatever it is
A doomday drill basically happens and i throw up some diplomacy treatises just in case and state isolation of it (assuming tons of dignataries are at attention but im not going to involve myself with whatever im BUSY)
The doomsday Drill becomes a serious threat and it lasts and I am just taking shelter
it lasted a long time-(like 6 hours)-something basically got triggered as heck...it was like a warzone/warfront happened (swell-up from someone who was mad not me tho)

this ship is basically ghosted because of all the dead is required after its business
i build a missile-silo in response to the terrible-day in the holographic simulation so i can just get back to work...it looks snazzy

hypervoid secretariate chamber with nightmare bo inside i guess near cold fusion reactor
glass drop technology too used with the secratrial rifting for very strong particle explosion
its incredibly more powerful than any other particle explosion (that i would have atm)
trad based missile technology with auto-droplet tech lights up with cytoflex (some sort of uranium coat for tracer-chaffe) (does it work for its intended purposes? I bet not! Oh well)

On Server:
ychip / vchip /phase for VRAM / OCXprocsr
nu-bomb plans for thaeler astra 1:2;3:ovulatory4:pouch:5fullparse (just going insane over symbiote threats)
full parse is just a full chip sometimes with aether or zeal
secretarial helps and so does old wax code
smart code helps/ sharp code helps/ various filler and chemigel help
works in hypeflex or hypervoid / maybe with fugue

(my server is getting hacked already lol)--i have lots of protections so its probably going to be TAKEN CARE OF LOL. (i get hacked all the time but this one feels like...some actual cyberterrorist hacking me over my project build)
arithmetic logic unit adder
primary ram
busing
masic control unit
cache
program memory type
machine state
and program counter
small clock

":boarding up the periphereal panel" which takes a whole gameday/gamenight
building a controlVbus (its broken)
"wanting to make a printer  but feeling 'out of the weather'"

16bit telegraph same as on the official site ( i guess it is anyway)

making an ender glyph because im tired of making a pc
phase control/ rom control/ program counter/ busing/ machine state 1 2 3 4 5
graphic circuit masic - 1 2
plc or cmos or something
routing for oem-built-in-gpx (ROUTING)
the actual reserved internal mother boarding circuitry (not accessorized)
dual core reserve
its actually very tight build except it also dont work
it is the same size as calculator too so thats a plus just skinnier
that can be accentuated as a periphereal placement would be about the size of the road in width for the edges
this is basically good enough to be considered done like a display model
just gotta fill the stupid gaps and put a chip on the mto look good and it can just fix itself
it will have tobe redesigned to fix itself but the GIST of the idea is all there in someway
if it matches up good enough then its FINE
space is used or can be used at some point it was designed and compensated in extra space (i fill it in later)
its a compacted model that is built to be expounded on that is why its called a minibox (i try to make the minibox work as a busy box or echo chamber with busyboxing tendancies)--this is also very good
the bonus of it being compacted it can be compartmentalized and will be now
so i feel like this is justified if i just put it together to make it look like it works thne its draft
the way draft will work is eventually it will WORK-Out when it has to knowing that IT CAN
but thats why i also offer it as a display model that is not garunteed
so this is all filled and if ignored about how bad it looks we can pretend its wired right
its a good example of where to start things off somehow
in theory it works but just not in practice (LOL me coping on how dumb this all is)
at least its something to look at but not really.

envisioning it as not a TOILET-COMPUTER in a LANDFILL of DEMORAILIZATION and Inhumane MONSTERS
just wing it man, certain goes go certain places and get some experience in tech i guess
if you were perfect you would be a freak of nature
another case of aim high fall hard, go deep and come up short
i would have put the vram into a retractable sheath or sleeve inset but minecraft doesnt really always the blueprints i need

MAKING UP SOME LORE: (its legitimate too)
wizzler room is with the new stuff i put signs up for and a shared b-tooth
it ressurections on the hell casket
THE BEACON HAD TO have encountered signals and we think an abduction droid passed it (AND NOW UPDATE THERE WAS AN ORBTIAL SATELLITE TOO!)
of the minera race the minera race is a top secret confidential end game race (not really tho)
possibly a scout for a queen minera of an oceanic type such as a manta or spore or shell
perhaps even a queen coral (these are a minor faction now UPDATE)
we think a queen coral nest has been discovered of a technological advanced culture
several oceans out we had a beacon discover several fluctuations that were traced to
NG storms and other sea activity including sea life and a droid was suspected of interfering (one of ours that goes missing)
we also get mini raided by someone who sets off a small circuit fire (or something goes haywire just a nuisance)--but maybe a joulethief
option to: SHOUT AT THE DARK just in case!

On Server:

Component BUiLDS:
Masic Control Unit
machine State
artifical randomizer (randomizes)
artifical random check (pauses randoms upon correct list)
dualboarding chip module (kinda have to have at some point)
automates for systemic needs
display model of course
just let this fix all the holes in the system
just dont forget what happened last time (system locked)

(Complaining about building the cheese-slice panel for the bram and such that i could have just had a floating vram)
that would allowed a enclosed keyboard space (still i will just likely slap a keyboard on top of this whole section)
(having second thoughts about the design but turns out my design is actually REALLY GOOD)

Building a cache system
could have edit everything on these other tiles and then added a phase switcher instead
everything could have fit behind the first grey bar (doesnt matter it all works out)
i could have used the blue panel for an extra ALU or something
an actual phase board
and the cheese slice panel for a mini printer instead (DOESNT MATTER can fit something around somewhere)
if i had done things right i could have had an ENTIRE BOOT space as you can see
maybe i need a boot sequencer or something
A BIG BOOT BOARD
I get bothered by design issues

My idea is going to be complicated as heck (complcitly complicated)
but the thing with static powers in used with wired orbitals (XSPINDLS)--i dropped this idea it doesnt matter (but yes it got even more complicated then because now here I am again revisiting everything at the start)
also has to match up with (others) so like those 2 with the glow effect (it can normalize based off signals recieved)---me making a transciever for an ulterior purpose and not knowing what to call it except an xspindel
glowEffect with the last bit being the zero dimension or (raw dataleak)
that is used with the last thing (the thaelor bomb)--a smart-reachygraby plasma EMP bomb)
that is used with the last thing too (the sixasis modul---its not a sixaxis its something else i dont remember...its becuase of all the sequencing and consoilidating it as a single computation)
that is used as the thing for orangeGLOWlight (standalone METERING/signals)
or a banking / clerking system again (THIS is more prevalent now with the UPDATE)
then it gets put in a cold fusion reactor with work (maybe i dunno maybe even a FAKE-REACTOR for a FAKE-TTY)
but for that i need everything in palce to be draft build mostly
this will be the loader for most of the system that is hereI
I'll just make it for a reserve (NOW I HAVE A RESERVE - subsystem capable Data-Tank Fillable MINIPROJECT that is more or less completed by conjecture)

I'll relocate the things with the backups reserve and dedicated mix/list
