actually its pretty big so i took out some install files and sitepackages to lower it from 3.9 to 2.9
i used it for a ubuntu gpt=engineering with bito. it works on latest python and generally it can figure out the site packages you need. i forgot to really list them for now i will later if its that big of a deal.
i typically use a virtual and my_env environment both at once on ubuntu cuz...why not
also it doesnt really work or so anything yet and probably wasnt worth the money i put into making it. lol (40 bux of gpt-engineering with gpt4)
