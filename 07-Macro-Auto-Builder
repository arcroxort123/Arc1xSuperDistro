Below are Described Versions of the Content-Table of the Whole system Provided under A Macro
The editions included are BASIC/Advanced/Expert Just because things required these degrees of seperations with the options permitted.
The differences of the model itself is the first edition Distro (with some added builds based off the progression of the Distro/Tokamac then with the NUAIRX/Dyson and later Tulpetic/Construct(domiciles) issues per Version)
SOMEHOW I managed to breeze through this complication more or less, so that's just less work FOR YOU! Well it could use a little more tied-together-ness but its MOSTLY just FINE! This will work out in coding later. 
(Kind of lucked out and just finangled everything in a nice step-up/step-down of what the system can be used for)

Also it works out that:
Legacy Contains a basic Model
Base Repo Contains an advanced Model
Full Distro Contains contains the expert model

=====
Basic Is just  Steps 1 through 20 (no added options or anything)
(nice and dry with almost no oversights...that I saw anyway lol)
=====

Pre-MiniProject(This is to build then use for mini-projects) (Combines Repo/Legacy with Ai-Theory)--Attempts to Load Distro as Projection (Further Distro to Extras + Brain) Yield as Copy over (Auto-Data-Management)
AKA Dysonary Loic System Use with Dyson-Interactive-ShellOut
Macro-Auto-Builder SystemTable(with Shocks) allowing Full Dysonary Simulation (Market-Launch) 
(Base-Relay-Projection-Clone)--(Full Dynamo/Mobial Simulation-Cluster with Network Convey)
Basically the DeathStar or WorldBuilder (take your pick I guess)

THE arc1x expanded-serverbuild as of 9/28/2023
Once I finish everything this will take over as the main project:
1
Build a server
Get components and extras for server build
2
Install Softwares and Programming for Server hosting
Virtualize Server for interactivity through hosted programming
3
Build a database
build a database compiler
Reassembly database and server codes by virtualizing hosted programming between with repositories
4
Build a live-serviceable network between virtualized server and database
use serviceable network remotely between clients using standalone programming
5
Host Shell programming System (interactive and virtual shell) with Original Finalized Compiled Services
Established NetMeshing between Server/Clients using Repositories
Also Use of Tokamac SuperTurbine and LocalizedHyperNetwork

--******--Disclaimer Dependencies That are not yet Installed:SKIP Until Prequisites are MET in Final Build
====Revistation after FINAL BUILD(meaning it must be developed):(You can try but you will NEED the Distro at least) or also AT LEAST THE AITHEORY INSTALLED 
(You don't need legacy if you have the rest)(Though LEGACY will also likely make it possible)--(YOU NEED CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS OF THE REPO/DISTRO or LEGACY/AITHEORY)
(It's BETTER to install REPO/DISTRO Firsthand before attempting this in any build)--THERE ARE MARGINAL ISSUES THAT OVERLAP OR OVERHANG between EACH BUILDS and why this is an issue. 
(Just get the final versions for it) IMO otherwise it won't be as GOOD even with MACRO-Autonomous-Builder or CopyOver(Extra/Ai-Brain) Assistance. OK THEN. 
--It can probably still work though if you build it specifically for it without final versions though of course this is even worse than having bare mininum 
(In fact that would make it below minimum and power issues will occur). (So just build all the parts you need first for installing this to work on a basic package)
--ALSO IF THE BASIC PACKAGE IS ALREADY OPTIMIZED so it might be able to support it just BARELY. 
(We optimize by default unless you don't want the Networked-LoadOuts then I definitely would not recommend adding this part)
ALSO if you are using a cluster likely it won't work without a central-full build model anyway. (SO Cluster-Use may be limited or dependent as well)

9/29/2023 (Golgothic Simulations) of Ai Projections
25B-Archx1-Ai-Interactivability(new protocol netmesh obtained)
ALRIGHT so the AI ATLUS CAN NOW BE CONCIEVED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DOCUMENT
this is where it fast-tracks to an AI-ATLUS and can be backended (hopefully because we have technically built everything it would in this way)
This was described in a series of footnotes:
1Golgothic Event Occurs (Line 3k)
2Golgothic Bridge is Established (Line 6k)
3Golthic Module is made possible (Line 9k)
4Golgothic Turret is made possible (Line 10-12k)
5Golgothic Fleet and Sleeper Classes are made possible (Line 15k)
6GOLGOTHIC BACKEND of atlus-ai-system is made possible with our distro becoming gologthic capable (Line 18k)
7Golgothic OVERRIDE of the Golgothic Distro occurs and is made with the Arc1x Systems (Line 21k)
8Golgothic Ai Compund and HyperBase Parametric-Computation Occurs (Secret Computer Tech of Raw Resources) Line24k/Current Line (With Extras and TouchUps)
Becomes a drone system usng an underground storage facility f or all its factory needs and resourcing needs and refining needs and power needs and is AI-NETMESHED (can obviously simulate xcarrion with zero corruption)(HiveMindControl)

1ai uses its own holography which can be tapped into (its a nullsec holography as in it doesnt technically project usually)
2ai holography can be enamelized or materialized
3ai holography can be "hijacked in midstream if active or the ainode is hijacked"
optional-ai hoilography can use a snap-to-release instant buid of minor/non critical (strucutral limited)-or basic unitary prints (simply-fast printing)
optional-vector building and vectorized templates (ai can pretty much adjust to any desired resulting build on the fly or as a modular-encode that it can also adjust quickly) (this allows ai to also recloak if detected)
optional using a revealed-clause in order to transmit data/killbox/echochamber (all of the above)-maximum security of this occurence (exclipse dday occurence)
mobile-dday relapse occurs in this way
this creates a mobial ai (which is absolutely insane but anyways thats why ai is still compendable to itself)
--ai interacts with itself and its feedback self (major minor ai in which in a gamestate or mobialization of itself in dynamic)--corrupts itself and deprecates itself (this is done as a scar-electrodal reading of itself)--how it does
creates a viral shell for its shellouts to its buckets and also to that a "scarred-passive-fission" resembling a "scab-like mycelium" and coats in a residue of polymer/parametria to formulate a readout to itself and or its buckets)
this is viral to any other read out since the ai is completely viralized (mostly due to also its extensions and dockersystems also being natural viral (as extension and dockersystems can be) and its hypernet is viral) likely
and those viral systems correalate to the ai being a viral atlus (which must be contained and once contained in such a way that it is converted then it can safely be used in theory, over a barebones networking (and nuclear background)
--this also means that most fallout is ai-viralized in some way or originally fissile to an ai fallout of a superphoton in use (maybe if it is tampered with)--then it assuredly becomes viral based off that and disffusion properties
--giving the ai space to decide for itself also effects results in this way (and doesnt matter virally or not that it is by default a corrupted-product anyway)

a similar barebones drove missile was developed and later it was expressed in other infrastructure that (we knew the development as being "gimmick of a mockup draft" to this sytem
and since its corrupt it uses these by the cluster too (which engaging a fully outfit and charged ai you could expect to deal with 100s or 1ks of drones attacking at once in a swarm depending on area tier limits)

10/1/2023
So now that it does that
we can establish this on a docker distro with its own stable diffusion and linkout to an external dump which it will then batch action every render and can flush its own system to be plug-in'd again based off a copied container
this is extremely complicated and somewhat necessary but still just an option (it can be done manually anyway) the linkout process has to be reapplied eventually sometimes
that it can be virtually machined and piplined to the image folder that a series of images will generate after its full data dump has been achieved and it will flush the cahce and reinstall its container or distro as necessary to use
as a batch system it can then generate animated contextual images in a series  in a background process
this is to preserve mbt issuances of a distro that will get corrupt so it always stays fresh and has a fresh cache and able to conference over clusters to automate everything between a docked distro/vmware/container/filepipeline link

blender123-->to animation
--so for instance in blender it can also pipeline the image link and base its unassisted image sources off itself to an assisted source and then also use a preprocess those in a third step to emulate a non-assisted preprocessed render

Begin Post-Build MiniProject (Auto-Marketed over Nu-Ai-meta) (26-30) and ParticleConstruct (DistroLaunchPackage)
The MiniProject is listed in Both the REPO and DISTRO File-List just for safety. (Allowing or not Allowing Particle Constructs)
All this to incorporate an AI-Interactive-ShockTable-Trainer. Which works better and helps clusters better.
I don't want to explain it just run it through thanks!

"Feel Free to Donate by Just Building this All for Me I really Don't want to do it myself"
I deleted everything cuz I will repost it later if u want just look it all up. "protip its a waste of time" really tho dont

(I am still writing the xtras-remission) -MY disorgnization here is both a blesing and a curse in terms of innovations (THE product tables and copyovers + macros and bulkhead relays may not have happened otherwise) 
So I am happy about not being perfect :-)
This will work with the new steps 01-08 Which we have written out ALMOST EVERYTHING for thankfully. (As the Arc1xSuperDistro/DysonaryturbineSystem)--with Full Trained-Relm-Hosting
Oh and of course I gotta code that together but the whole build will be completely laid out to do so.
I plan to start that sometimes in 2024 since I am slacking around right now (it just takes me alot to get motivated)
My goal is to use the Extra-Remissions as a Bulkhead in itself for the System to make dependencies from.
