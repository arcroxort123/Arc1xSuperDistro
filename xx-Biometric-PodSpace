Now that Everything Seems Good and Ready to Develop a "ExoStation" or Interplanetary/MoonBase etc.

A biometric adjusted podspace used for containing a sealed control enviroment.
Draft
Requiring a glass lattice or polymer lattice
Requiring Mechanical adjusted motorcages or grids
Requiring sensors and a network of wiring
Fashioned to a bio-dome

SetUp/Build
This will be used as a sealed housing for an expansive area or launch site
This will be used in a coordinated fashion for particular vocations or priority
Similar to bulkheads and the podspace may contain bulkheads or other modules

Purposing
The original biodomes in theory are built to house plant-life/flora/vegetation for general oxygen supply.
The environment must match standards for life, including humidity and temperature and precipitation etc.
The panels can be used to mitigate heatwaves or distribute air current in a sealed environment by adjusting their orientation and angles or positions.
They may operate as a seal or expose the container to external conditions for fast adjustment of their habitat.

Advanced Purposing (A few things suggested) (With/Without Day/Night Cycles)
11 so far (not gonna stress these ideas just a base system of suggested/reccomendaed usages:)
----
Oxygen Production and Habitats
Power Systems and Ozone Management
Collective Sample Test Chambers and Labworks
Storage of Items and Module or Residencies
Use of a Chemical Plant and Refinery
Gas containment and Filtration
Methane or other Fuel Resourcing
Radiation Therapy or Quarantines of Objects or Subjects
Food or Livestock Production
Crystal Farming or Ice Production
Terraforming or Factory Automations

The Nexus Frameworks for SECTOR or PARSE alleviation(bypass or travel)--Supply Chain Protocols 
(This follows all Transfer Protcols From the very beginning and legacy to any other mention therof--There have been 5 or so total that I think I remember anyway)
At least--It follows a strict practice in handling outside-elements and verified data (That is double checks and triple checks and or just completely checks at least for every level of integration/interactivity. From surface to deep levels)
I will link these up later when I feel like combing through everything to point them out.

These can be connected by bridges/bays/docks/ports which are internally provided for and may require allowances or permissions for use in external/remote access for any instance or third party.

StandAlone Assisted Protocol (SAP)--S2T (Sap2Tap Turbine Enforcement and Power Driving MatchBASE Regulations)--GameSET(reserve per queue Pool)--Population and Conventional Proceeding 
Clerking Control(Character Limits and Data Limits) and Safety-Weighting of Loadouts (Prep and Passthrough)--(Specialty-Standards and Faction-Permission)--(Signature Commissionary and Boarding-Checks)
Defcon Policy Security Enforced Licensing and Registration (Typical Trafficing Credentials and Certifications) and Digital-Catloguing (SqlxSqrl-Logging PHP-Compares)(Flag and Check Detouring/Rerouting and Warning/Alert MOTD/Notify System)
Safety-Intefacing and Advisory-Cue-Maps and Pathing-Itenary(Suspension/Siezure/Denial/Rebound) as well as Retention Agency (Holding or Apprehension of Hostile/Contraband)--Crime(Protections) and Briefing/Release Programs

These are conditional modules or bulkheads or stats (etc nodes or canisters or just anything that can be deployed) in such a way that are done so in an isometric launch or connection)
This streamlines complex launch tables and connections based of formulative deploy (Sequenced Interfacing) between transfers of objects/data/environments/decklines
A full deck can be docked in such a way to admit partial or planned integrations with its source and target (Comergent Issues) in which certain orientation/positioning must be upheld for either case (internal/external negotiation)
This is a expedited way to simplify or handle complicated measures in delegating transfers and allocating where space may be limited or required in trafficing a routine.
This is Typically a Customs Approach and can used over a session with a kiosk or other vending median as well (Mixture of medians and or node-communion//particle array or emission of draw-nodes or swell-zones or any indescript-gathering or collective matrixing)
This is just to handle all complexity of data-handshaking and buffering as well as portal-object directives to retain data or objects over their transmission and plotted course of travel in a sterile/clinical secured-behavoir.
This assists greatly in match making and custom preferences as well as Macro-Alignments in case of conflict or exemptions in programming (to be adjusted as requests are met or additional demands are recognized impromptu a contract/order)--at which task/jobs may be Reprioritized as well.

Why Biodomes and what to Validate their Usages with:(Things Get Slightly Serious here)-Neeto

Full Scale Arena and how to Condition the System for it: (As to not allow Outbreaks)--using (Ai-Entities or BioLab testSubjects ETC)
Isometric-DeadZone can be contained in a biodome which may result in a 'loic temple' sacrement (artifact/article kernalized corruption)--in which destroys the piece and intiates a War-Training-Sim (this can unload Bulkheads and activate NumiModule for defensive and security incursion methods (in defcon)--which is used for training.
its just like cerebres in xmen lol (how cliche of me but its literally by RUNNING THE CODEC did I find this --maybe? just trust me bro i know it to be true)
(for robotic combat training)--this creates a datamosh environment which more or less trains the ai under a heavier influence than standard caseworks (can be considered accelerated i guess)--or at least on demand
here is where i would say alchemical/gemetric casts have a higher level of influence (being that it is virtualized in a 'loic ruin' basically as a final boss system more or less --or that a more powerful than average homoculus would be availible in this condition
---and for that i am basing on  bunker/region system being converted anyway in an incursion as a (homuculus relay) but that effects emissions which i havent written out and i described it very breifly
That because of the advancements in the dysonary there would be homoculous versions of the domicile being a homoculous scepter/tower/relay/loic but im not sure how to describe that again. 
(When at the bunker stage the next stage is that it compeltely seals itself anyway into a dyson relay with jump drives)--this is why i just jump to the conclusion 
(ai not need be mentioned or rival systems---just describe it as the nuetral ambient (but overall hazardous homoculous systems)--which have been prevalanet since the start of the v-rail
(at least during the construction of the nexus where 'scp's were collected and trained)--for xrelm or paranormal stuff (but really everything is basically FATED to reach some ultimate form or another
--this describes it as an early-arrival to any case that a non-faction "entity" would have developed it in this case "sleepers or homoculus depending" on their level of attention
the homoculus and sleeper cells were basically more or less capable of "a full tech tree" by the time of a titan situation having occured (or at least would have developed in that stage)-to be matured at this point or sometime near this point prior 
(i've already described the points at time at which these occur give the natural progression of the entire tech)--it happens roughly after nuarix was completed and usually at keyframes is it declared "very likely" to be a confrontation anyway
The scenario of the Isometric-DeadZone (Training Camp Biodome) marks the full DEV-ACCESS and GATELOCK "Security Clearences" of the system for which any training program may incubate an accelerated usage of (any time of entity previously mentioned) including Xlich and "Corrupt Numirators" which are considered a high-threat.
There is specifically a glitched/anamlous Exo-Suite (ShadowClone) warrior in a specified Scenario that can adapt as necessary to levels of Training (And Generally is considered the Most Versatile of any Encounter offered in the Arena)
The ExoSuite-ShadowClone generally benchmarks the Arena and allows testing/interactivity with any users (under monitored interactions)--and should be considered a special access-tier in which Faction-Permits or Tokens have been used to exchange a trophy match involving the ShadowClone. (For which rewards mastery in the tier--increasing stats and profieciencies per success)
Reward issues may be seasonal/temporary or allow for a slight-overbearence in vocational skills or dungeoneering abilities.
