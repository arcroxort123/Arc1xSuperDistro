Now that Everything Seems Good and Ready to Develop a "ExoStation" or Interplanetary/MoonBase etc.

A biometric adjusted podspace used for containing a sealed control enviroment.
Draft
Requiring a glass lattice or polymer lattice
Requiring Mechanical adjusted motorcages or grids
Requiring sensors and a network of wiring
Fashioned to a bio-dome

SetUp/Build
This will be used as a sealed housing for an expansive area or launch site
This will be used in a coordinated fashion for particular vocations or priority
Similar to bulkheads and the podspace may contain bulkheads or other modules

Purposing
The original biodomes in theory are built to house plant-life/flora/vegetation for general oxygen supply.
The environment must match standards for life, including humidity and temperature and precipitation etc.
The panels can be used to mitigate heatwaves or distribute air current in a sealed environment by adjusting their orientation and angles or positions.
They may operate as a seal or expose the container to external conditions for fast adjustment of their habitat.

Advanced Purposing (A few things suggested)
11 so far (not gonna stress these ideas just a base system of suggested/reccomendaed usages:)
