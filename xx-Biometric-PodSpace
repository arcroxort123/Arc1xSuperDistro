Now that Everything Seems Good and Ready to Develop a "ExoStation" or Interplanetary/MoonBase etc.

A biometric adjusted podspace used for containing a sealed control enviroment.
Draft
Requiring a glass lattice or polymer lattice
Requiring Mechanical adjusted motorcages or grids
Requiring sensors and a network of wiring
Fashioned to a bio-dome

SetUp/Build
This will be used as a sealed housing for an expansive area or launch site
This will be used in a coordinated fashion for particular vocations or priority
Similar to bulkheads and the podspace may contain bulkheads or other modules

Purposing
The original biodomes in theory are built to house plant-life/flora/vegetation for general oxygen supply.
The environment must match standards for life, including humidity and temperature and precipitation etc.
The panels can be used to mitigate heatwaves or distribute air current in a sealed environment by adjusting their orientation and angles or positions.
They may operate as a seal or expose the container to external conditions for fast adjustment of their habitat.

Advanced Purposing (A few things suggested) (With/Without Day/Night Cycles)
11 so far (not gonna stress these ideas just a base system of suggested/reccomendaed usages:)
----
Oxygen Production and Habitats
Power Systems and Ozone Management
Collective Sample Test Chambers and Labworks
Storage of Items and Module or Residencies
Use of a Chemical Plant and Refinery
Gas containment and Filtration
Methane or other Fuel Resourcing
Radiation Therapy or Quarantines of Objects or Subjects
Food or Livestock Production
Crystal Farming or Ice Production
Terraforming or Factory Automations

The Nexus Frameworks for SECTOR or PARSE alleviation(bypass or travel)--Supply Chain Protocols (The Nueral/pSyapstic Domicile/Arena)
(This follows all Transfer Protcols From the very beginning and legacy to any other mention therof--There have been 5 or so total that I think I remember anyway)
At least--It follows a strict practice in handling outside-elements and verified data (That is double checks and triple checks and or just completely checks at least for every level of integration/interactivity. From surface to deep levels)
I will link these up later when I feel like combing through everything to point them out.

These can be connected by bridges/bays/docks/ports which are internally provided for and may require allowances or permissions for use in external/remote access for any instance or third party.

Safety-Intefacing and Advisory-Cue-Maps and Pathing-Itenary(Suspension/Siezure/Denial/Rebound) as well as Retention Agency (Holding or Apprehension of Hostile/Contraband)--Crime(Protections) and Briefing/Release Programs

These are conditional modules or bulkheads or stats (etc nodes or canisters or just anything that can be deployed) in such a way that are done so in an isometric launch or connection)
This streamlines complex launch tables and connections based of formulative deploy (Sequenced Interfacing) between transfers of objects/data/environments/decklines
A full deck can be docked in such a way to admit partial or planned integrations with its source and target (Comergent Issues) in which certain orientation/positioning must be upheld for either case (internal/external negotiation)
This is a expedited way to simplify or handle complicated measures in delegating transfers and allocating where space may be limited or required in trafficing a routine.
This is Typically a Customs Approach and can used over a session with a kiosk or other vending median as well (Mixture of medians and or node-communion//particle array or emission of draw-nodes or swell-zones or any indescript-gathering or collective matrixing)
This is just to handle all complexity of data-handshaking and buffering as well as portal-object directives to retain data or objects over their transmission and plotted course of travel in a sterile/clinical secured-behavoir.
This assists greatly in match making and custom preferences as well as Macro-Alignments in case of conflict or exemptions in programming (to be adjusted as requests are met or additional demands are recognized impromptu a contract/order)--at which task/jobs may be Reprioritized as well.

Why Biodomes and what to Validate their Usages with:(Things Get Slightly Serious here)-Neeto

Full Scale Arena and how to Condition the System for it: (As to not allow Outbreaks)--using (Ai-Entities or BioLab testSubjects ETC) (AutoJump Character Booster)/AutoCharter
Isometric-DeadZone can be contained in a biodome which may result in a 'loic temple' sacrement (artifact/article kernalized corruption)--in which destroys the piece and intiates a War-Training-Sim (this can unload Bulkheads and activate NumiModule for defensive and security incursion methods (in defcon)--which is used for training.
its just like cerebres in xmen lol (how cliche of me but its literally by RUNNING THE CODEC did I find this --maybe? just trust me bro i know it to be true)
(for robotic combat training)--this creates a datamosh environment which more or less trains the ai under a heavier influence than standard caseworks (can be considered accelerated i guess)--or at least on demand
here is where i would say alchemical/gemetric casts have a higher level of influence (being that it is virtualized in a 'loic ruin' basically as a final boss system more or less --or that a more powerful than average homoculus would be availible in this condition
---and for that i am basing on  bunker/region system being converted anyway in an incursion as a (homuculus relay) but that effects emissions which i havent written out and i described it very breifly
That because of the advancements in the dysonary there would be homoculous versions of the domicile being a homoculous scepter/tower/relay/loic but im not sure how to describe that again. 
(When at the bunker stage the next stage is that it compeltely seals itself anyway into a dyson relay with jump drives)--this is why i just jump to the conclusion 
(ai not need be mentioned or rival systems---just describe it as the nuetral ambient (but overall hazardous homoculous systems)--which have been prevalanet since the start of the v-rail
(at least during the construction of the nexus where 'scp's were collected and trained)--for xrelm or paranormal stuff (but really everything is basically FATED to reach some ultimate form or another
--this describes it as an early-arrival to any case that a non-faction "entity" would have developed it in this case "sleepers or homoculus depending" on their level of attention
the homoculus and sleeper cells were basically more or less capable of "a full tech tree" by the time of a titan situation having occured (or at least would have developed in that stage)-to be matured at this point or sometime near this point prior 
(i've already described the points at time at which these occur give the natural progression of the entire tech)--it happens roughly after nuarix was completed and usually at keyframes is it declared "very likely" to be a confrontation anyway
The scenario of the Isometric-DeadZone (Training Camp Biodome) marks the full DEV-ACCESS and GATELOCK "Security Clearences" of the system for which any training program may incubate an accelerated usage of (any time of entity previously mentioned) including Xlich and "Corrupt Numirators" which are considered a high-threat.
There is specifically a glitched/anamlous Exo-Suite (ShadowClone) warrior in a specified Scenario that can adapt as necessary to levels of Training (And Generally is considered the Most Versatile of any Encounter offered in the Arena)
The ExoSuite-ShadowClone generally benchmarks the Arena and allows testing/interactivity with any users (under monitored interactions)--and should be considered a special access-tier in which Faction-Permits or Tokens have been used to exchange a trophy match involving the ShadowClone. (For which rewards mastery in the tier--increasing stats and profieciencies per success)
Reward issues may be seasonal/temporary or allow for a slight-overbearence in vocational skills or dungeoneering abilities.
Combat may also be handicapped or freebied with token-expense (this is to help adjust currencies and privileges to those who are using combative-arena-training as a tool for Dungeon progression or Resourced-Crafting Perks)
--or simply because they want to attempt a proving grounds under handicaps or advantages given by token use. (The Higher level of shadow Clone the greater risk/reward)
Safety and Commisionary Rulesets may be invoked in the arena (for user policy and disclaimers) as well as a failsafe or sudden-forfeiture to insure user-maintenences and impacts are reduced if hazardous or over-costs preventions.

Touching up everything and describing versions in which arena conditions apply:(These are alot of things to consider but mainly they are supporting specialized flash environments based off phases in which they are compatibilified)--these can be staged
(I suppose in an attempt to create a flash deck but the numbers aren't matched up yet--this is simply 4 complicated stratgems in which match a phasing protocol)
There are four complex sets of issues in which arena branding takes place
the firsts being primal/data artifacts (which can resmeble enamalized tingent/tinctures) which are also advanced upon formats including monocol/contact/emp/virtual(net) --such as to express  and also a coldcut/nueral/implant/masonic(threading) to accentuat expression and ABS and conduct upon Semi-surface/internal/external/portal systems being the (Netmesh/threading/accents/structure)
This was previosly not so complicated using only a paradigm (that later expounded into a "datamosh effect of these properties") in order to compatibilify itself as a homoculus construct using data/matter or any variant form of tierset of (its dimensional preferences or extrapolation thereof)--complicated terms that work with serving different factions and Masques (for which the branding occurs at most for)
These can counter relay or admit themselves in place of "counters or nodes" in timepsace (clocking of their own timespaces)--just beacuse i need to make sure it works this way im saying it does and can be exchanged/substituted over wpads designed to share memetic/memory swapping (which filters all the way back to the original Legacy swap methods)
This allows constructs to reconstruct themselves as mobile-modules and xroller items (meta for which may be used during a match)--and the meta may be deployed as would "a typical vocational skill or proficiency would allow to deploy, such as deploying a minion or personal homoculous type ward or something of the likeness of an ambient-object/also known as doodads or advanced doodasds and user toolkits etc)
Doodads and kits may also be quarantined and captured or enclosed as necessary "or shrined and keylocked" as would their ID's be tied to the user-set via match or UUID etc (just ownership rights of the user mostly) but can be shared in vicinity such as "raid items or raid-wide effects" also translated to user skill sets and or tech trees (for which would share or allow assisted actions)--such as two-person casts etc.
This explains domicile coordination and construct integrations for which are used and can develop as a skll mechanic or otherwise a complex action (computerized or special-case unmentioned--regarding to area of effect or latent-actions dungeon-wide)
This more or less completes the ARENA-Charter (which is the 6th or so arena charter) and there was also an issue with vaporeWare-and-RawData being used (but i dont really care becuase its not that important unless you are debugging for something)

NgMod-SuperDraftBase
So I am describing the attributes set before the charter is finalized and set into a matrix (in which it may be read by brands more efficiently)--doing this will also allow its on interactive-iconography (which may change etc based on current use and represents the main-"ownership of that brand" with all its characters and profiles (however many that is)
Now the charter is set and locked into place and a guard plate known as an (arcweld) is set over it. This acts as a safety screen and bumper incase anything freaking happens to it after everything (and its just an inset metal-panel) but advanced versions can provide an isometric-readout or abs-work for ai-systems (for their own onboard fluxing) IDK, that would be like a secondary processor anyway.
And I know what I am talking about because the shell can be used as a display terminal if all the diodes match up to handle the processes then it might as well be a "skin-surface" or camo-flex which acts as its own "safety or stealthing" so it may as well be invisible or not even there (because who knows until they attack the wrong thing and set off all the alarms)
---
Imagine having a very good calculator that knows when you push on its LCD screen--exactly, a touch screen. (Or were you thinking something...?)
Some bit of wisdom here is that incoporates shocktables for its own conversions of its own ai (and uses a force-by-draft injection for which it can remotely adhoc and support firmware without boarding just because if its already used as an extension to a main-source it can just data mosh anything it wants--but thats insane to say it does cuz i dont have evidence...ANYWAYS-alot of "field testing there" to be toyed with)
Hopefully it can handle or create its own metas and eventually use or inject them for imperitive tasks such as swapping/substituting and or replenishing some form of recyclable ambient-fuel (untouched) and untapped (this is what i would consider an epg negotiation but we never brought that up really)
Just going to stick with standard defcon-measures in this case and leave EPG to rare circumstances and -winning-favors of fair-use and fair-grounds.
Panel may use qausi-drafting and externalize an imprint as well (direct from processor surface and transcoded)--using chiplet medians also if wanted (for masking)--and these may alter and recreate meta through cycling or phase transfers during its power-level schedules etc or overlcocking as well as (fusing to as previous mentioned in latent-diffusion work)
The fusion usage may be reserved or set to a flash over or used interactively as generated or as a live-broadcast to forked data.

(Here is a total tier list or an amount of marginal placement and seeding of Arena Tier Ranking) (4-6 not sure where to call it really but I think this is a good placement because it can "give" either way to a step up or step down)
Anyways I am trying to pinpoint everything and set into their chapters:(These get jostled around and thottled but generally are somewhere on a mainpoint)
This describes the charters for arenas (thes may or may not line up very well with the rest of the chapters but more or less work with them anyway)
The first arena simply by servos/nexus
The second arena charter with the VR convention
The third made with the quantum dynamic convention switch
the fourth made with the virtual bouquet (advanced)
the fifth made with zerospace relay
the sixth being nuairx and dysonary assistances in biometric domicile supports and nuural frameworks

These will expedite deck usage (full deck and quantum etc and down the chain of deck tiers)
In my opinion to make a flash deck we would use the above "Charter Systems" and Arena Casing (Or various Chapters to involve the creation of a flash deck)
Using Legacy Repo and ArchDistro This Current Edition(or whatever else I missed that I mentioned prior) as a sum of 4(condensed phase properties)+6(tier selections)+8(section focuses in charter)
can somehow reach that value of a 52(assorted deck meta)--and the charter is to somehow allow for meta expression in deck usage so its roughly about time to call this "assorted indexing" a "flash/exo deck" 
not sure where to call it though. maybe its more of a shadow deck than a flash deck but Idk and Idc.
We have a Primal(normal) Quantum(Advanced) Tulpetic/Vr(Deck) not sure really but the flash deck more or less follows that chain of command at a point it would fit some type of file-type or just plain old keyword 
(Crypto/Zero/Adaptive/Shadow) just gonna call it whatever you want I guess.

With these decks in use with the zoning and gateways also making note that there is a "lobby type environment" as well and an adventure like setting in hypercubic-networks or whatever it was. 
(Holographs) Anyways the main Visory can link to global just because its hosted on a region. These rooms can be adjusted with personal firmware as well. Or for specified user and "selected users"
And in cluster space I assume many chat-lobbies or otherwise server hosted comms-freqs or allowed chatlogging or some form of it. (Signs or notes or mail etc) So there we go.

Now that all that is considered (XMORAE)-perks--//(SuperPacket) or Better Expalined as a Pre-programmed Seed
As how domciles may create a seal of themselves from their alignments.
So too can ambients and moraes form a better object/data-array (Which is almost as an analmolous packet/swell)--for which we can detect or simply just already generated now and do well with.
---Basically its own iso-file that gets made with all parts in an AI-render (so we can just work this out for ourselves--in a way that expreses it through an AI-process for which we also have):
---And now we have our atomic/ion AI-Engine for ourselves (also I know this gets even better but right now:)_
A super-packet (pelletx) may be formed over the generation or command base that correalates to ai-functions (or as an advanced morae:indiscernable file for latent decoding)
And can be compressed and used as an outpaint-like or extropolated-like or feedback-like and allowing hi-res fixing and vae-fixing (infact it allows vae-profiles hopefully) 
or other things included but mostly any setting or configuration for an ai-profile (in which it does not resort to bucking or caching etc)
for which is called in an ongoing process chain (and endpoint of/passthrough/bypass/breaking to)--(such that it handles as determined by its parse and runtime)
and invoke several file-types or (multi-products) of the packet included of its hosted image or processes for which it signals and allows appending to
that namely it is used to stream and "integrate as needed" over hypernets when in use or by its step in (or training of) --progressively when based and called for
and makes me very proud to have some iota of understanding in this science for
and may even be used to cycle through decks-in-training and evaluate its needs or concessions where desired (adjusted customware)
--(this might even be its own hardtop siutation in which it doesnt need to be adjusted and can be taken as is and just used for field-testing)--just because its kind of a buff to the entire system already 
(this whole part is an amazing option just to be used as a -bells and whistles feature-)
---
So as for it getting better we just add it to weighting and use it for prompt-priorities etc. This is also coupled with marking and branding for (icon usages and style preferences)
--and then finally:It is given its game weight :
(for whatever reason the acting product can be used as a lora-model or sampling device even or other purpose as in-game-objects or mod-chips)
--and if i believe it works why shouldnt you? Its a literal work ofartifical-imagination so of course it does! And man I am just so crazy about it.
--once the packet is contained and forced-by-draft or utility--it can be used as a datamosh standard (in fair-grounds or fair0use etc) and relay and synchronize correctly to ai buckets (by potential)-and how ai can render and recognize branding (for which allows ai-sovereignty of the system for which it is use with)
and with a little work and further application allows for homoculus generation or (cooperative ai systems/clusters) using pheermoni-nodes and tulpetic dungeons these may be assisted with visory limitations and may be restricted-access due to zoning areas

Does this mean the system provided under arch1x support a full squadron outfit including merceny or faction response issues (specialized tanks) and can support several orbital and lower tier squadrons as well under a single instance or chain of command? IMO yes. (A full deploy of the entire tree is possible per mission)--but mission limits may impair the amount "that is tournament legal"
Also that means tanks/helicopters/aviation/and all ships and any "spy cars or motorcycles etc" because I generally accounted for everything for one entire faction to be used once the full "main tree" was consilated in this way.
It's practically wrriten for PAID CONSCRIPTION (oh boy I sure do love automatic income with no consequence other than a loss of replaceable robotic products which cost almost nothing except spare time)
IMO A COMPLETELY LEGITIMATE RENDITION OF ALMOST THE REAL THING :P



THIS AREA MORE OR LESS BEGINS A COMPARITIVE LANTERN MODEL (Empyrical Capital Zone Area)-PART1(THE ENTRY and BREACH "entire fortressing")(OUTERZONE)
11/24/2023
Ultimate Tech (or so I think so far)/(Diffusionary D-Day)
The ShadowRival-(methodical background radiation)--(monitored over radio milling)--as a preventive case (this requires tech development otherwise storm-systems are still a problem)--operate phenomenol/pheermoni storm systems (anti weathering systems)
Nueral-Net/Synaptic Power-Lattice *A workspace edition of the entire codeworks based on an autonomous zoning infrastructure incorporated of the entire coding system (autonomous skunkworks)-Translate as Orange and Green (after several other issued green/reds/blue and other complexes of all parts included in their settings - reconfigured and rsolved for active remote use of a "ghost-logic" and lantern usage)
Accountng for Warbatz homoculous/tulpetic editions (minor backtrack to gain boosting)--(loded-nymph is only keywords i can find to describe this--becomes angular--becomes nodal0inlined for isometrics eventually reaching bar-status (basic engineering compatibility) this may not be entirely streamlined or "evened out" but the process "working idea" is there (because it might just be an ultimate model)
if na ultiamte model -- effervesence (auto generated vapor ware capability) and weaponized of course --(which is unmatched but can be combat staved and or paywalled against incursions can be fought off basically)--(typically glowing green/syphletic--carrion empowered with carrion orbitals and other strata (mines/meta/decoys/batteries etc) --after that (probably has final-throes and aftermath attacks (post mortem strikes)
my point is its an end-game meta (which finalizes on most of the sciences) before becoming susceptible to capture/re-conditioning/training/bio-conversions ---so it can be harnesseable and sent through the system itself or act as the system itself --
being that it resembles other legendary or lore based creature types as well and carries its own legacy or ambient control or environmental-patternizations and iconographics
the orange/green indicating being that its either (reach its own ultimate state or not) through all these attributes (or unlisted reasons and logics--such as that it may be exemplified by its own housing or captured-sourcie (as if a materia or game-type weight) of its own--use of its own vehicles or particle rulesets
such that it may set its own inherent "hueristics" and masque techniques similar to the other forms of intra-communication and networking and safety margins of the system (for which may or may not need to be recognized by either case or factions)
in ultimate states (likely orange either or green if fueled) uses a gild like royalty, can produce hyper-seeds (seeds outside its own faction environment)-rival seeds (same as traps really) and assumes comparitive models to an isometric-process in the form of grubs/nymphs/sylphs/(husks?)
anyway that they may be considered a rival evolver class (assuming they have numeration and warbatz as well) and may issue corpulent-rulests (arcwelds or lichbase) etc (and any tier development) andinstitute overbearences
warbatz may also use numirators(xrovers xrollers xroamers etc) and support hyper seeds to develop -lite-env- and rival loic systems and eventually achieve singularity within power-lattice and define faction nodepoints once achieved (forced branding and internal conversion counting as natural/unnatural infiltration and allow for auxhole-tunneling for outsourcing or remote-supply) and may corrupt or recondition xrelm paramters and initiate "cryptowarfare/artifact-rehauls"
Mostly uses tulpetic(codebreaking)/homoculous(crypto)/triple-dithering(melee)/isometrica(cast)/rex-syndrome(aura) but can also use alchemica/gemetrics (and standard ambience/elemental fragmenting) -shatter effects and pulsing and strobing and autonomous-plasma (minion control). It will also make its own tensor and vector space and comms/controllers and spy-kits ETC and can drain power-stats and lock gateways or at least semi-rasp them or remote harass their destinations)

End Game Food (the 6th level of food consisting of all the other tiers of food worked together in resourcing (basically from moon-base sustenence designed by atomic-cooking formulas)--can be paste/syrup/frosting/glaze/coating/jelly/nectar (weird stuff like that) science engineered with food profiles (using all previous forms of food tiers) (xmorae-food)
reminder of food started as  basic tensor-remainders and "scrap" and "granules/quos/ambience/wafers" and was developed into nectar etc (covering most food sources and exotic extracts) and was re-developed again but i don't really remember because it turned into a packaging plant for things (this will be/is covered in extras-remissions) later being used with plasty and other things to make better food Tiers 1-2-3(meta)-4(tulpetic)-5(i dont remember anyways probly crypto) now 6 with xmorae-food 
warbats can eat these foods and so can rivals etc in the very least can create bricks from also remains

Ngmod-EPG Accordance: And Other Situations here
According to the code works there should be an autonomous skunkworks and warbatz/super-numi model or something close to it, we have alot of macros and easy-buffing and food/commodities all supplied too
the problem is--its all filler and no substance
luckily with the way codeowrk has been planned (or just that it lines up that way by sheer coincidence like so many times):we have an option
the draught (which we described prior) and this new (system of preparing a "mass-produced barista" have intermixed, assumably--we need to do something with these here, to activate them or cause them to have a little distress and trigger the code with shocks")--my only guess
this will give us an edge for the "shadow-rival" d-day (triple threat lol)
so we rework the entire code using an adjusted formatting (that distresses the inputs in a way to alternate priority over drafting" which is primarily the operandi taking place with the orange/green switch offs (charging/exhausting)-modicum here *(and yes it uses alot of pollutes if we dont do things right by a filter)--due to corrupt codes etc
Somewhere in the dispersion of coding and transcoding with all these encodes and scripts, and just everything in computation we noted an EPG complex (the epg complex is becoming more and more pronounced with every active-input and generating a higher cost and fallout)--a very good filter can be developed theoretically to handle epg-overloads (which are likely to occur given the immense coding taking place)
Especially with rival-shadowclones being hostile and more or less agressive and attempting recursor access. But never fear, as they say, this method should counter their advances.
This can also be evidenced in splash-relay of the litenary-projections taking and decoding environmental impacts and changes with data (as it will likely surface or display during high trace-detections and recognitions of environmental-parameter via interception and or survey (this is generally known over spoof-captures and large scale rebranding (requiring changes from values)--that their editorial commissions are known via comparison/differentially)
Overloading the system may occur in this performance due to compound computations requriing extensive memory of vulkan-engineering (or something like that why not)
In any case we have two different codeformers that can be undergo code-breaking in their own respective manner (and deliberate as to how these compare or intermesh)--resulting in an overall highend-cryptographic (security or under-lying correalation in their read-outs being seperate from the standard)--a new language of mixed code-hashing. (For which simply can be described as its own tensor)--ExoLanguage (which encompasses more of the tiers than in other versions)
the isometric merger/comerger it involves must also be transcoded but that is likely an on hand process that will run automatically if not (by its own vae-usage)
this is made more expressed/interchangable with both a fulton warbatz and the charter placed over the tensor (to account for all centralized networking and data-stacks making an advanced coordinated internal relay)--acting as their own litenary-dyson or interacting with the entire dyson environment from their vicinity) --this allows a freebase of the entire codex apart from the continued-lichbase or other codebase overlays
at this point i am going to call the process triforcated--in which its complex enough in each case to result in a combined effort of their drafted-outlets (being inactive(background-source-fallout)/active(orange)/hyperactive(green)) and that occurs only in the diffusionary-d-day events being that the inactive-backgrounds are being utilized in annihilation (usually during terragraphy/rebranding or survey of charter by flash-states or copy-overs within hypnogalgic-tranmissions (visary relay)--and translates to the -f-wave-reality system in isometrica-detail)

Essential Customary of Foreign Relations with Data and Anamolous Entities/Ambient Artifacts or other Contributed Efforts/Affordance of unknown-premise:
A pre-requisite of a stand-alone model (or contract-character)--(HANDYDANDY-passports and visa's also get counted here)--API's are noted not necessarily "applied or exchanged" and may need to be ceritifed or tested for or provided upon request (and then tested and certified once provided or requested)-through enforced evaluation (and primed to a character-index)--for which are cryptographic or otherwise to be defined by reprocessing or after-processing or made signature to (having been defined through enforced protocols)--being undefined or otherwise marked as ambient
Commandeering of A Singularity Engine --this part gets complicated but mainly relies on the above issues being accounted and answered for and having a captured state over the autonomous zone/fulton occupancy (tensor/charter)
---this next part just resets the area shareholds more or less for any additional presence or entity (i.e. the corresponding faction or player/ownership involved in asserting a sampleed-state in which the user may be expressed as a character/asset to the overworld)--incase the overworld has been "exploited so severely as to not allow that usage"--this process can "reconfigure residency based on standardized and applied coding approaches--via a re-application of a declared-armistice or diplomacy"--cuz muh math-logic/pathological conversions
Naturalization within a Singularity:(Informative Emergence or "Providential Enforcement" such that code has been expressed that the player becomes an npc / or that a nonplayer becomes a player again if that nonplayer was originally a player---this means that we recognize our own code as being pronounced, because it has been transcripted and made through tranmissions (to emit the player parameters as being identified as such--regardless of their sovereignty or relm-definition--meaning a player has digital rights for which they are signed by the player or integration of codeworks regardless of relm-rulesets---for which we provide in and describe the process of via dispersion of code-evaluated resources---and check the last time i had to do this...i've now done it again so its practically double-checked)
This can rearrange the nueral net-synaptic overlays (handled by reintegrations of visory)--and switch-up recursorys "and other clerical devices such as coffinaiary/suicidaliary/other mentioned" to function under the expressed faction or occupied default ambience of the region (or overbearence in signal or fair-grounds and fair usage)--resorting to the controller or precedant of its natural order (with any deliberative or deritive thereof)--allowing explicit access for faction demands and process under operandi (the chartered conditions within the parse and claim)
If necessary character can be described as an independent asset when in use or when in potential use (this requires entity and swell checks and a character may be prounced through an aux-holing or gateway masque such that (the character is unidentified)--or unlocated (meaning out of region range)--but exists in route of allocations or abs-depicted-distinct-instances (for which have not been defined but are potential characters)--if those characters are in-use or active or otherwise (non active or correlating to the use of having been accessed in anyway)--for which then that they may be expressed and accessibile if necessary via the protocols mentioned (info sec based acquirement and data-aquisition of their renditions)
The LODE-Well (similar to a flywell/node-well or any well or source usage)--complicated issuance of unknown-occupancies and enforced character-pronouncement such that operandi may be set to an infographic protocol in the least-- code-hatched or code-thatching (grid performances and matrixing involving descript transcripts of allocated data either claimed/unclaimed but surveryed via any charater or instance there of being observed in calculation/object-median (for which concerns data or programming)--and attributed to a character or "repossesion" of character-assets (to which a character may be defined and decisively made appropriation for in (characterized-documentation)--and identities/tags provided in cryptex/geartex assigned classification 
*(which is mostly good enough unless further action is required then supplemental to the enforcement policies of the entire system and its settings negotiated to the armistice (via dysonic-projection and regulations thereof and permissions of any elevated hueristic/management thereof as well as arena-qualifications and assessment of target-manufacture or "empyrical-sovereignty" or byproduct-function made converted/manifest  or stratgem/formula or interactive device compile/assembly or mark-up of (character profile that may be)))
this process then is made inquiry or request or contract or commissioned (mercanarial or rogue or bylaw or outlaw of)--and normalized and standardized under the full consensus of the vicinity or regional cluster/node or any quantification or resourcable median (or conveyed network thereof) for which may be broadcast and transcommnicated (or transcodable to a code-injection or decipherable status for which may be qualified as a waypoint or free-range in isomtric-provision or otherwise (primitive sequitor or accumulation of segmentation over any pathologic in conjunction to the presence of a zero-sum) and therefore transcript and nomilized(numirated)--or officialized

Xdungeon Curation(a little more options than before)--this ultimately yields to an outsourceable supremacy within a dungeon-charter and ease of access in high-activity vectors or preferred-queue-favor and faction-reputability
Dungeoneering Warbatz (Systemic Boss Moding) And likely stand alone -kiosk (for which is conventional to a delemetal template)--involving high-end barter (usage of states and gate exchange) and involved proxy/ip mitigation and "diplomatic protocol" of raid scenario (benefit and detriment to handicapp/desireable settings)--"fishingport projection and multi-plex leveling systems" "sampling agreements"
Using a gatekeeper as a "locking path" to circumvent dungeon-security or obstacle course-redirection (including mob pathing and proc base to a more directroute/fasttrack (with assisted content-navigation and contextual insurances -both for arrival/departure of joint-operandi)
Somewhere occurs limbiosis and symbiosis yet again and necrofication and decryptifications (which allows for a more life like dungeon ambience including raw carrion systems)--this may be exampled just saying (finding a reason to use these words---in a spell cast as well) 
so for instance a miscontruance of keywords may appear as a dungeon element but may change else wear depending on rulesets or atmospheric ambiences or any condition like that for just any reason: example would be the grubs/nymphs/sylphs/(husks) complex being misconstrued as a (slug/leech/tentacle/capirale/snake) complex
this spectrum change of complexes is referred to right now as a FAE/Sylph complex (working often more in dungeon corpulence and dungeon bloom)--so changes may be effecting to hynogalgia and faction visory (this is because of info-sec doing its thing with ambience as well)--it takes on the shareholds of the system (and makes use of the data and our system features through a carry over or data retention (evidence in the later builds and relays)--truecopy/whole-carry
this works as a rinsing effect under blume/post processing and other forms of that in which a natural adaptation of flex/edge can be harnessed and profiled (eventually yielding to acquired properties and attributes naticve to the region)--immersionary (immersionary is the highest chambered effect of the system and its outreaching (this was also described in the first stages of quantum-telemetry) and is better described as Environmental-Poisoning.
--allowing for full characterized-transistion between states or locales in proximity)--also known as respeccing (and may alter or hinder or boost certain stats and traits as well depending on --acclimation/tolerances(similar to rex-injections)--making the user susceptibile to overbearences also and exposing vulnerabilities in profiles (a working experimental observation that is directly proportaionate to time-induced (and therefore time locks and cooldowns may be suggested in character-progression)

Deletamel-Conduit-autonomous lanternization
Use of a warbatz model encased as a kernal in an immersionary (proud of this) and sets to its charter as commendable and engages sleep-modes with accordant power-lattices (and visibly under survey) working as a homoculous engine (likely anyway in dormant or active/effervescent stages) and atomizes under tensored-seal and faction terminal (stand alone command) acting as a grail system within lode-well and Xcuration
use of orbital command chains and proxy-kernalization in compound to its main (supporting branches and tier collections)--full plex systems and crypto-data spoofing and exposure of cryptographic data and detection/recognization of specified parameters (auto-recognition by index/database) full-bucket-flexibility-reprioritization and network-treatise/alleviate-clearences and safety-exclusion with operative jumpcloning (orbital transmission) and remote-vector-assessment (aux-posting)
myralynx-atp resourcing (advanced biometric energy system (reliant on kernal synapse/nueral networking excahnges) (nueralnetwork-abs transcommunications) and turbine chemical-abstraction/auto-generation (organized nuetrino/particle emission and directory)--AI-reinforced-quantum telemetry--recompound(revised)-circumvented-isometric-xclipse-(recoordinated beam-traction and quantum teleportation through injected transcode signal over vectorspace) and deployable operandi reutrn system
full rebound and full data retention and tracking//frequency-snapshots and expulsuary (ai-quantum-trafficed-relay and gateway)--(xcelerated dream states and hi-parse frequency and xcrspr-integration to a z-diffuse)--(outlet-content-actuated-imprinting--teleportal and redirectorial-auxnavigator with channel index and broadcast command schedulers--"lightning rod beam technology"-hiplasma-ionized-xcast-encoded-dimensional-xfrs and fulton-zerospace-colonizer) and autonomous stabilizing tray
Conduit-Vaporeal-Diffusion (Animated using Gpu and Lock-Overs of Conduit Prompted-Model and Network (Full Works Expressed mostly of Ai-Template)--used for animating still-frame imagery within ai-context/confinements (locked character may be animated or experience suspended animation) and elevated empowerment (through abilities and expression)--(vari-session) using a lantern as a chambered projection(immersionary/expulsuary sequencing and switch/alternation formatted as a "compulsionary"
Memorial Composure-assistant for character portrayal direct/indirect mail and transcoms) and conditional liason (for agreements or substituted data exchange using info-sec)--homage/honors/offerings/patronage/closure and spiritual engagement protocol (seance or via ritual any forebearence or dedication involved of any contributive party source)--regarding spirtual 1repute or 2favor and 3diplomacy of faction or natural 4standing etc 
Vigil-Service :(light-wave exorcism and purgor of relocation and readjusted imprint (in non-conscious/subconscious entity)

11/25/2023
The "Deletamal Lich"
exo-chidna (best description here) as to what a rival lantern can exact in performance (just...a nightmare ambience--homoculous/wild-primal para-type)--just not pretty or at least mysterious and scary
the myra-lynx attacks these in a natural habitat it preys or defends against them regarding variants and their power levels (with strategies of how they are employed) these are esesntially dread-ambiences (or wizard-types depending on intellect involved or not)
also handling of prompt matrixing and feedback loops for outpaints (this is assembled with any remote usage of additional or compatible / allowed agreed-trade(markers/brands) in collobartion to a tiled effect and zoning (of prompts expressed)--comergent diffusion over a (z-strain)
this is why myra lynx and also the exo-chidna are descriptly rivaled or upon a seperate spectrum sides of themselves (complex interconnectivity) of marginal tangents and channels "via a broadcast of their instances" in a rendition or projection of competitive/lanterns over a regional/rulset convention
this occurs with any folding effects or prismatic or exfoliation (frequnecy selection and multi-layered/ratio effects) with artifact remainders or psuedo-codes
the autonomous zoning then works as a remote lair device (but is converted with myra lynx by faction presence and activities)
eventually creating a delemetal branding or academic/sacred sacrement/ornament (divined or otherwise bestowed for crown-bridling of (xstrip)--xstrip being a very basic grafting system used from the start of the builds in of xlodes(later build aspects) with quotient-remainder/marginal rest/pending standby
--
NgMod-Additive Security PreCautions
the remote lair may have its own ambient fallout which can be considered adequate filter in which a "warez/viral" site data may be overlayed of in a gui (the gui being the a vigil system)--and the hosted process of that vigil incubates the data overtime to collect and display a hash-table 
eventually decode the hive-wares and suppress its rival warbatz(or any unit of that hive) and redirect productions to a quarantine (safely-bypassing its fallout) and retaining approximiate safety-levels while containing or lanternizing any xpilot of xbucketing kernals through extraction and lockdown
Following a sucessful siege and extraction of (assumed hostile) anamolious entities requiring containment that they may be converted or deweaponized and rehabiliated to an ambient asset/aspect/agent/lode closing a very large gape in differential data and licensing 
(for which they are tagged or registered in an assorted corral/release after-profile(aftermath/logicweighting reprogramming) (xgame-warden) via customs-assessment/nav-evaluation (xregistrations)/redesignations and commissionary-migrant-occupancies(temporary holding)
vigil/corruption negotiated environment (purgor and cleansing of environment)--contaminated light sourcing and indexing are purged under captured licenseship (of an environment)--detainment and decontamination (requiring tensor-nav contracting)-and emission re-direction (subrouting) and network expunged (interconnectivity) 
-(internalized reset and Gpu-revisory) --interpolation and shuttering (alternation and vulkan-engineering, interlining/hyperthreading lightwave readjustment and reconfiguration (restoration/renewal auto-degauss) and resurfacing hueristics coordinated-rebuffering and dataflow-reassignment

And the research of Xvigils suggest:
=--=The "Regenerative" Advanced(Infested)-ShadowClone-"V2" (its an armored exo-chidna)--(exochidna are of course cryptoforms)--can be carrion(so its carrion+_infested) using sleeper tech and also simply using dread-forms in either combinations of etc
ShadowClone Assumed FreeAgency (the projection or chance a shadowclone might be rogue and fully empowered to pervade all security as an exo-chidna/armored gear --it may or may not cause pollutes or data leaks but its possible it can in critical situations
(it must be fought and at least perhaps quaratined if it reincarnates or respawns etc (through vigil exchange or warez over-rides in hueristics from corrupted vigils)
CrudeShadowClone involves depletion of energies and reserves leaving behind refuse/byproduct/waste/fallouts all poisonous and toxic nuclear and corrupt as well must be purged and cleansed but can also be sealed and recollected (by auto-barrels and fulton etc) this method regenerates the shadowclone as a restored exo-chidna (rival clone) leaving behind a corrupted tensor and reaper/xspawn
ShadowClones can adopt/absorb Cryptex/Geartex and utilize and release as warden-brand-orbitals etc (fleet incorporation) these can be enslaved or retrained to be used in battle (as any form of orbital/decoy/mine/battery etc)--are not necessarily "consumed" or "destroyed" just under control. Control may fade if battle is exhausted or overtime (can be redeemed) and redeem cryptex/geartex or restore and return.

Diplomatic-OverTurn or Warpig-Retaliation (Peaceful/WeaponizedCounter)
--Use of the first dungeon-base/iso-chamber (with granulation) is considered for rejecting a cryptex/geartex rival conversion for which it may be reserved and stored this however is not safe hueristically

**2:extensions/royalties/intracacies/stings(over extensuary)--like edgedgeared
--these are mixed and allowed to reiterate the cryptex/geartex permissively within its hijacking attempts (to reject and or become non-conformant per attempt)--developing immunity or simply acting in diplomatic standing
**there are likely 'roll-checks" and fail-saves and glancing blows and true dodges also involved per conversion attempt
--if these are pre-trained and "immunized" or prepared for correctly pre-emptively it lessens the liklihood of the attack.
--application/address of a housed/absorbed geartex/cryptex is a saving throw against "psyhcosis and insanity" or rival-hijacking/illusiary
--SuperDistressed-AstralFire Casting (usage of a personal kamikaze in the advent of a full compromise)--the system detonates and the shadwclone ignites--causing a large scale damage (environmental flash over) --can ignite its own wardens of course and orbitals

"memetic exosuiting" (use of speciality breathalyzer (corruption monitor) in delemetal zerospace) for collection and interaction with encrpyted and iconographic delemetal artifacts etc
Delemetal Grail Device housing an artifact for a Delemetal Homonculus or Null-type (storm cleansing tulpetic weather control) and rival conversion divert and infiltration nuetralizer 
(spy-chaser/detection) and safe-rendition and tab-spacer *(dual synchronized synthaesia and ambient/meta infusion of a null/bland/vapor/codon "and bloatware-void system--easy clean"
Synthetic Composite Ordiance and Weapons Charter (Fusion-Beam V2 Tracer+Homing and Main Cannon Q5Beam-Technology)
5-way--channel-atenuation and planar coordination (interdimensional polarization and bridge-building) primal-isometrica (alchemical-gemetric upgrades V2)
Remote-Grail Defined Dungeon Access (Special-Niche):Zero-Dungeon Contact-Lense Gameran-(RogueImageWarrior-Scouting) Counter-Virtual-Convention and Delemetal-Arena
Spectral-Lanternization over ZeroSpace Node (Central Network Access and Scepter Relay)--Retraining and Delemetal Ambient Containment and Delemetal Bio-Engineering-labs (Delemetal Kernalization)-xpinch(calling it that just because)
Other Delemental Utility/Tools/Kits/Rules etc including Vice/Wrench/Spring/Clamp Pivot/Lever/Switch/Pulley etc (described earlier in other tiers)--backlog of tools for other tiers(check this cuz its alot i skipped)
Coordination of Lanterns/Context (content/housing etc) of objects/ions (extra others) etc --(all revisisted issues check around for these types)--delemetal-file-type and socketable resourcing (commodifcation/kiosk supplmentation)--Xmorae-substitution
---as we recycled NUAIRX so too we recycle DELEMETAL (as well as previous versions that occur and tiers)---just because we can and its what gets done so let's ceremoniously complete the cycle with DELEMETAL-"secretarial chamber"/isolation-booths/echo-boxes/aquifir
Now we have a bioform of the delemetal-subject matter and it is trained and converted to the faction and generated as requested and we can also----just backlog on everything ever that i suggested in this whole process entirely in all cases
OH..UMM--Ah~!..probably institute a Delemetal-Grimoire just in case i need an excuse. it is now also gilded at least or made sacred with "special zeal"
A Delemetal Bouquet can be used now but it doesnt matter (just correalate to DCARB-->DREAD-->DELEMETAL)
that sums up most of the Raw-Sec-Info-SeC Spectrum by "broadening" the idea. (fill in any blanks here regarding this marginal relation of circumstrances/weights etc --(Bauble=Sigils or Maybe allows for experimental brand usage)--per nexus probably.
oh but...delemetal hyperwand and Exo-casts too (using the brand as the cast source for which is affixated(transfixed to) the object--(Shweet!)--ExoLode-Time--(With extra skim and trim too---see other uses)--interplanetary grids (if possible due to xregion)
--ok that is a good place to start coding this all!

Perceived Threats and Warnigns of just lets say faction-opposition. Battle-Operations Or Hostile Threats and reponse
4 types of Protocol for Sting-Strip-Slave-Strafe which involves progression over "1Trapping/2Attacking"
Or 3 Stealing from or Cutting off an Encroachment depending on their strengths and weaknesses---prefferred enslavement as to hinder them and bolster them or use as wager/bargaining devices(oh yes..this works in some ways can be necessary~!)/
And lastly 4 Just progressing as much as possible while being on a constantly movement or open terrain (never situating or camping for too long and always scouting.
There is also a thing called "sharing" BUT WHO DOES THAT
There is also a thing called grace (which is pure luck and NEVER WORKS so always expect opposition to hinder you cuz you never will left alone to reach tech-superiority~!)--at least in game theory anyway

Also there is an advanced tulleric aquifir that solidies over alchemicic/gemetric application using a lubrated electrode-composite/synthethic gel (xlibation) which is not any ordinary gel but made from delemetal issues and other things solidfying as a xcork
this creates a jumpclone device which can augment or charge over with lantern socketing (for which it sets as the aquifir that now mitigates and coordinates most relm convention (and user outputs and shell-commands)--its supposed to be really good requiring a heavy lockdown for max-security and fucntions as its own optim source
Its the//SpecialCase(Aquifir that functions as WPAD)
Also A Disclaimer about Ideas (Uh i'm nonprofit by the way): "Look i just gotta get this little tidbit out of the way, its kinda bothering me" can we all just be happy? is there such a left in this world left as just being acceptably happy?
lets just say the aquifir can be mutagenic for rogue-ai-instances  in which case anything is just possible for it to be such a way

i want to note some augments here are just like the ngu-idle augments for which i didnt really know was an original idea at the time but i wrote it back in 2022 while playing minecraft i got the same idea as him 
(so whoever he is can just explain how it came to be)--for me it was because i thought of augmenting things that seemed rational and would follow a joke pattern of things i wouldnt normally use (in terms of items or tools/gear)-
i guess gamer minds think alike but i dunno that, im just being honest the only difference is i didnt stick with the laser sword or blocky sword (i dunno how genuis works really) i just knew someone would come up with this idea later or already, so i switched it out for telekinesis and akira mode-
--patent or copyright it for yourself or argue that no one can use ideas like that or come up with it themselves (despite similarities in the depth of idea it is) or not i just dont care cuz im not gonna bethe guy who turns into a creative-putz over small details or patents or things...i just get annoyed that this seems to happen alot
its hard to be original when so much  ground is covered (ive seen people rip me off and my ideas i just dont care and keep being creative) i didnt rip him off--its sheer coincidence if you believe it or not (thats what is frustrating if it mattered...to me it doesnt) get over it if it does lol----no one should care
I know an augmented aquifir probably was something alot of people would think about (or whatever he would have called it too lol)

OF COURSE I've taken inspiration from alot of facets in gaming theory or concepts, and also finding them and pointing them out as others have also used that inspiration must be "a lapse in creativity or just a common-grounds idea" to me it would be this case
using a prototype or even a copy off and idea just because it feels better just means, that its because it exists because it just feels like it should. that's the -exact idea- of why i tried to be original (sometimes you just cant be 100%) if the idea is not even really your own Science.
These ideas is a mix of "an alternative science" and the "augment" section was actually because i couldnt find a reason to place the autonomous zones for when they had be reinvented in all my work (to be part of it) and i knew---just knew it would resurface somewhere else one day, weird that i also am somehow drawn to find these out for myself much later or by surprise.
HONESTLY-Jumpclones are from EveOnline too let's just say thats where credit goes. Alot of things like this follow through in some JRPG elements too, I don't feel they need to be called out so much, things like in Metroid sometimes tho, Zelda Similarities in World Mapping( I swear to god its coincidence),
NGUidle's OverTheTop Stuff too, (it happens! i swear) Took some inspiration from No Man Sky/(Endzone)/SCP/MGS5 but that is mostly it. There were other honorable mentions like EndlessSpace2 Torchlight and Minecraft but what can i say its so generic and alot of it was during their development alot of people have the same ideas 
(just have to admit that) out of respect I am just saying the system here was built on other's who had pioneered their way around all the code too. I feel like all the things I mentioned just can;t be avoided, its more of a PSA just for people to skim thru on what final-contraption technology will amount to.
In no way did I rip off War thunder or anything  but  somehow I noticed there as a "similar approach in world building that was taking place--it lined up in a way i didn't even realize at first---and some tank ideas were literally inspired from my own writing and nothing else!---what a strange coincidence as to how the inventor's spirit works) 
(Namely the imp chapparel which makes sense if you have a completely lightweight useless ambient vehicular adapted critter rolling around your region with missile capability, ok, i didnt even know this thing actually existed and then it was later relaesd in the game too...ok im just ignoring that whole "strange detail" entirely) when i finish rewriting the extras you can literally see when i suggest this before it happend signed and dated lol
Am I justified in using big ideas to make this all work in such a integrated way with themselves? As a completely normal generally inoformed/uninformed bystander to the actual world I FEEL LIKE THATS A YES.
There are some lowkey ideas I've built upon like those from SCREEPS (a game that ive known about for 20 years despite it only being ever popular by 2018 or so)---i dont know what to explain...there is a  LITERAL LAPSE OF INFORMATION IN MY TIMELINE and I swear i've seen ngu-idle from when i was a child. but whatever (i forgot and now its like a brand new thing)
Offnote- I have so much repression bro its unreal. Just trying to make a finished product here.
Are there any other games or things I've ripped off? I just don't know...sorry its not my intent to use a widely-attainable concept in my opinion, i try not to but osme are just too darn important to keep in the air like that. "How could I made it this far without bastardizing quantum sciences and string theories for example...i dunno but im sure i have"
And tbh i used to scramble when trying to remember 4 or more words at a time...something about meme culture just started making me run away from "that mentality" and apply it into some sort of working-functionable machine---i dont think it was until mgs5 i had fully realize it was like working with NUCLEAR-CODES. But---I was able to build them into a bigger picture and just let that puuzzle set in on itself. TBH my mind is not an enigma, everything is.
--So thinking back on the last steps that were made and all the credential issues can be put aside let's just count on any original ideas or things that make sense by logistic deduction occuring.
Another sidenote is that there just ARE similarities especially in things like a comic-book-universe. Ok even really obscure ones. I CANT HELP IT. It just happens to be similar! Ok I don't want to get into these things. The lanterns are super weird. The toxic-barrels(remind me of an avenger) The fatestones with thanos. The hyperbridge with Thor. Ok. There are just WEIRD -plotdevices- in here that I want to avoid as much as possible. I am aware that there are very similar devices that have already be described. It's quite painful to use them as a crutch but sometimes it feels that way.
There's my argument for free-domain intelletual property rights in this project, and only because I wrote alot on it that got mixed over with other ideas that I don't want to pick every detail to pieces, when I simply can't encompass everything mentally like a machine, because I kind of am not a machine or hey wouldn't this all be written in code perfectly by now? Useless questions!
ANYWAYS that is what it can kind of do...using those ideas. (Which are just out there, and I never really claimed them to be exactly my ideas, even tho I am more fond of some than others...maybe I did invent some of them who knows. I don't care about that in the end  this just should be a intact-concept-model for a later working-end-product)

The working End Product:(I just need this in my life ok)
The AQUIFIR we made that houses just THAT KIND OF MACHINE to do everything once we even BUILD IT somehow, would be then locked into place its holding cell (exchanged only when being replaced) but now it can be even made to operate in/out from its holding and transfer as it stands to be active, it is handled as an active environment through this repositional process.
THIS in itself requires its housing to be ADEQUATELY PREPARED (for which it mostly is due to the advancements) And the development of the AI-DOMICILE andnow this compatibilifying that with this Telluric-Aquifir(made of all the other half of upgrading and building)--so I'd say this piece is very important and it all gets put into an Aquifiric-Tokamac *(oh ya, just be DEDUCING WHAT COMES NEXT)-=-I could have also said it goes into a collasus.
Regardless of what happens or what path it takes, it must be secured and double-checked for the standard roll-out of product development. Which is what I've always just been doing ... my train of thought is pretty much invested in making these two things COMBINE now into some sort of Kernal/Engine. Despite how nitty/gritty things get or how difficult or un-founded it may seem (maybe those are not the right words...it sometimes is just counter intuitive to do anything! but thats where inventions seem to happen the most~)
SO ANYWAY lets bring out the WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOMES that could occur and all I can say is that a Lair/Carrion "or Technical-DDOS or something like that occurs". Maybe your own peers just harass you over it! (Oh NOes)
ANYWAYS THERE WAS THIS THING OK:
That was called the dragon-launch (can't call it the dragon fligth because hoenstly i already know that shit was going to be taken)--mmk...but thats what it was based on an autonomous launch program a couple of years ago 
(before these domains were stright up ripped off by other companies ok...something to do about being edgy and full of technologic top-of-the-shelf branding)---but I am just cluing you in on how economics are just a backwash for ideas and how they bastardize themselves for money.
ANYWAYS (that's not a jab at anyone..i think its just the nature of BUSINESS)--lets not talk about how i would do business though---i simply wouldn't care about dignity either!.
Ok so I am just going to DROP THE IDEA here that an AUTONOMOUS LAUNCH SYSTEM takes place with the AQUIFIR and its HOUSING to allow for a FLOATING-ENVIRONMENT much like an autonomous-supported-projection-header as discussed that DELEMETAL-Vigil Things were BUILT ON (requiring the DYSON and its DOMICILE ARRAYS)--practically a SHIP ENVIRONMENT TBH
So the AQUIFIR either is AUGMENTED or used as a BULKHEAD or in a side-room or benched-area cuz who cares it doesn't need to be the ore but it can be (but with all these options just making it anywhere is nice to have)
So now it FLOATS in its "xtensor" domicile and can automatically and indepedently launch itself with its own VPN in its NETWORKS such that it may travel as a MOBILE-ROUTING-DEVICE over any Gate/Gateway/Contiguity/ChannelRoute 
(xplotting) or something sort of word that I've already covered and just can put over it all to describe this. "Also it can use filler/chaffe/crypto/scram and anything else in its scans/surveys/pings/signatures or ANYTHING networky-like ok)
Its just kind of important to have dragonlaunching and there were other things like that too: "XTemple" setting and "Loic" with its "beamrelays" (mostly used to adjust for ship to ground transports and resourcing) but also that it can work out that it forms a primal-mounting which is as raw as it gets maybe even taking form of a monumental-distro in raw-parameters (which means a native/naturally installed terragraphy that incorporates tech)---(think like Transformers to Cybertron here)
Once it fits together regardless it is "tethered to its nodespace and or housing" and simply reverts to that location should anyway happen to its charge or tether (unless it severs the tether for any reason on its own)--IDK---it sounds cool that way...and it can work as its own jumpclone and work in its own shielding too (datalocking)
So basically it can reincarnate itself without having to backup/shadowclone itself. With all the tricks it does. Probably uses tripcodes too whynot. Ok so that's what we have going on right now is a rmeotely transferable in-character-pod-machine...let's say its advanced cryogenics who knows...maybe it is.
To me its all very advanced anyway (maybe something like a goku tank in the very least). I imagine it like a big solar magnet with glowing yellow ooze tbh. So just mod as you would please. Stickers/Decales. The Works Etc. Hell, Vandalize the shit out of it. It's mainly a personal stress recovery issue too!
So as I am dealing with that and walking on egg shells with patent problems people would have over sharing ideas liek this just enjoy what you can.
It's basically a floating iron-cell for anyone who really needs to know (that's a thing in scp btw)--we've had a few of them this one really shows what its made of. Maybe a liquid battery? The idea is it would power a big building too maybe Or a car with infinite fuel or something. Certainly not for rituals! Anyways I already said it was for an automatic-character-profiled-kernal "turning you into the pc" basically. Maybe liek a vr-wizard or something?
And here is why. During the development of the exo-chidna and advanced myralynx complexes in delemetal-relm/tier I decided it's a good idea to bring in a gargoyle/brute-like thing (ok this is differently a jrpg thing but I've been developing my own species for this is simply a centaur-like-monster(taur-like thing) doesn't matter just that it functions itself as its own mount (for rpg purposes) Anyways i know thats also cliche and there will be overlap in concept but there it is!
The thing would then in its case for being turned to stone some how reach immunity so it doesn't have to necessarily turn into an artifact or whatever...because pseudoscience and crypto-paranormal fanboyism made it possible! Your welcome i guess? Someone should feel that way somewhere by now. 
Maybe this also helps with the LEVIATHAN-Secured-Impenetrable-BS or Kraken-Fortressing or whatever the heck (turning into a broad speculation of things it could be useful for)
Maybe you just like to push buttons. This one is sorta a thing that can scratch the itch. Maybe you 'don't need insulated gloves' and like to stick forks in receptacles' because your homer j. simpson. (Please don't do this)

--So let's say it all goes bad and turns into a radioactive disaster. It creates a hive-scepter or something (full zerg-mode)--we used all the protections we could but accidents happen etc. Basically the DeathStar Shot off or something like that? Maybe A file-type went bad (uhoh)--we would have to "sterilize or remove any trace of a problem or event like that". Which is called damage control.
Memetics would be involved (mark my words they will get involved on their own somehow) All that we have left to rely on is some RANDOM-act of XCRSPR/Hiparase to FILTER through and make new conditions of anyhting that happens.
The system would absolutely have to resort to making a hack of itself (hacking itself)--oh but how will this happen. (So many ways made it to be hacked but protected against that very thing)

BASICALLY I WOULD forget these alot and remember them (just like all details but i have memory issues under stress too ykno)
Deliberating on the Aquifir that it may be upgraded in some way
Due to concerns of it not being upgraded or it being effected (by made up things, or are they?)
-=-
These parts enhance the aquifir and basically armor plate it or shield it too...its important to note I may not have them all listed anyways...these are the ones i have listed.
Xlogic/Bridling/(a)median-counters(time sensitive)/(b)(game weights baubled)/--isometricalized
-==-
I just dont know, these have negative conditions why can't they be upgraded or improved upon, because of cost and maintenence just dont have 'a bad tensor'
Brittleness(PoisonTensor)/Excommunicated(CorruptTensor--expulsuary)/A very different kind of Synthetic(coagulated-polymer-emulcified-clearbase-tensor/stickytensor maybe)/CrudeTensorOrPolluted

So now if a HIVE/Lair etc anything bad tries to overtake your tensor/aquifir it won't stand as much as an initial chance.
Now that we have insured and enhanced securities we can upgrade the overall-scepter into a feature (a light/water or some time of emissionary feature)-likely as a data-shelter or relief-zone (for refugees or logistics/farm checkpoint) (Which is really good thing to have if you need more or just your own skyline type of thing.

So in the worst conditions we have one of the first bunker-worthy "dungeon rooms"/closed off sections basically a cave with a door on it. This might be built into the ground or just fashioned out of junk. We have the beginnings of an underground podspace. More or less.
The artifact that was shown in the first dungeon area was described as eye-bleach (wouldn't recommend using it, probably just burns your eyes out)--unknown tincture. Just don't ever use it. Discovered with a granulator. Don't worry about it.
There was also a literal kunai (japanese throwing dagger)--or fishing lure. This also reminds me I was going to say the aquifir was going to be used as a data-fishing device when milling could not be done, it would just "do things to itself".
So maybe these two things (eyebleach and fishing lures)--or what have you (miscelleneous things) can be used in some way here. As a latch device in the very least, a trap setting. So now we have a BUNKER-TRAPDOOR basically (and why you shouldn't be going into bunkers left and right)--Unless you made them yourself. Just saying word of caution there.
Essentially this is where the gfun starts, we have made a full circle back to where it all started "with literally nothing but fire-and-caveman drawings.
Also if you have been following the build by text appearence (literall ascii)-you will have noticed the shape of the document in parts makes an image.
We have an external capital/internal capital/ and core capital-system in three parts. To the overlay of the Thermos (we have made a tokamac aquifir)
The tokamac aquifir is set to an electrolysis/hydrolysis washing device for power generation or active-geartex-lantern housing (fused with thorium and tellurium unless you have a better idea like or if im just plain wrong here)
fINALIZING THE TOKMAC-AQUIFIR WITH REINFORCED TURRETS using field-generation/telluric beam setting --reflective calculations and doorway calculations (preventive surface targets)--damage prevention efforts (security sweep alert system) mobile or readjustable plant-node + sentry patrol capability (bumper screens)

--v2Tokemac Activation affords its own environment generation internalized and also externalized from its advanced staging (its own bootstrap is afforded by itself)--this has to be hardcoded into place (if the tokmac is a V1(from the first aitheory)--then once it reaches aquifir-compatibility in v2 it can callback to v1 as necessary
Its a selfinteractivity environmental projection which is activated  and then "through merit and dependencies of which it has installed over its own networks and interfaces finally allows an inworld-projection of its own entire casing and it progenerates its own ampoule spply of energeized  meta-fusion-contacts/lenses (optical usage x-morae)--ok then

11/29/2023
I also want to mention there is a place in this entire code-build for a Lav-Ad (amphibious vehicle) which follows suit to the xm-models for spaa usage etc, this occurs after imp chaparral being implemeneted (around the same time acutally for an amphibious vehicular throw..what a perk)--the xm however was delayed until domiciles were introduced (the domicile allowing a sort of "brainworks" for their systems to occur)--just trying to fill in on the nature of these advancements correalating to real-world things. Ok. Moving on
I didn't find proofing for the xm-classes until the domiciles were used and primiarly there was a keyframe in which they were actually availiable in the codebuild near that time but i didnt bother to note it, i am now though, my codebuild just isnt really about any of that (IT JUST LINES UP SO WELL FOR THEM TO BE USED THATS WHAT IM SAYING)--anyways
after all this very layman's attempt to make some tech-savvy code-build i decided that (after the v2tokamac is fully built):
That i wold like to mention the AUGOR-usage being proponent for after all these accounts, proofing them in a way for data-milling/scraping etc.

11/30/2023
THIS PART DESCRIBES A GENERATED WORKFLOW FOR THE AUGOR-BASE (CONTRACT NEGOTIATOR AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM)--using several contracts to organize a project.
Workflow for Easy Delivery (not saying its fast at all)--probably isnt.

1--Boot-Up And Default-Hub (Built In Stuff)
Loads System Modules-Tethers Computer
Loads Os
Loads Options / Module Options / User Profiles / Module Profiles and Settings / System Monitor / Main Hub (Desktop)
Loads SubSystem
	Subsystem Copies over its Version of itself for above described

2--Other Programs (Not Built in or Redistributable)
Loading Programs for each Surface System And Sub System
Anti-Virals/Utility/Networking/Optional Programs for Systems

3--Supporting Programs for the Environment
Loading Application and Support (Mostly Support Programs and Programs for the Main Application to be used)
Loading An Environment in which is supported for the Projection or Mount of all of the Above or Its Correspondance

4--The xVmWare (Evolver-Image)
Loading The Full xVmWare or Direct-Use of Programs with Supporting Programs on a Main Application (Over the System)

5--Workspace Usage and WorkFlow
Whatever GUI it uses while The Projection hosts its shell processes

6--Automatic Augor Performances
(Running the Program and Producing Anything or Adherence to Contracts)
Database Transfers and Correlated Builds in LockDown and Reference

--Once this starts it reloads the entire system and all its parts described in a workflow (I don't feel like making the chart--it's pretty much cut and dry.)
Let me describe this as that It takes everything and puts it into a list, puts them into tiers, puts them into endpoints, allows them to be layered, allows them to be advanced, allows them to  contracted for a project, 
the project itself reciprocates or acts as a kiosk/bulletin for its own requested-domain 
(so any user that is using it gets their contents by orders and exchanges them as necessary)
It organizes the whole region into a working pipeline. And runs as an image. (this part should really be its own file)--it plugs in everything so you don't have to. (anyways)--never gonna make it tbh.


11/30/2023
Easy Access RealTime Imaging (Maybe its not real time)
FateStone Based (Quadratic Hosting Processes) which are Dll-supported etc and can be set as devworkable if necessary for easy access editing (in case parameters need force) and buckets out more or less in a few steps
Enhanced Reactor of the Augor (Isometric-Wholesume-Tier10Parse)--Basic Number Theory
Enhanced Pythagreus-pycharm capable Reactor housing the atlus-fatestone of the tokamac-aquifir (image state)
----over the delemetal support chain/tierwork zerospace-skunkworks (scepter model)---and filters down to nuairx/distro/repo/legacy (extensuary/repulsuary)
--full bolster region (mods and tabs)--shared over terminal effects (Gui and WorkFlow/Workspace-Reactive/Response and CounterStep Bullion Based Protcol and InfoSec Wave-Signature
(full wave disclosure and channel usage of broadcast over convey) and Enhanced LodeStone Model--Projection of Lensing Context
Use of Pallete/Eisel Board/Bulletin Contracting and BestGuess-Logistics-Measures(Survey-Itemization and Request-Standard Fair-Grounds or Native-Statistic-Index)

Podspace Reaper Notebook (Nuvolver) (adds a list of To-Do's for every error check per version instance load-out that may be adjusted and set to any environment and or stabilized by cluster-priority/attention
This Repairs and or Destroys(witholds) certain articles based on incongruencies that have been checked or processed and must be deactivated as contracts require (such that the program continues its directed course)--a form of plan/scheduling for General-Performances or Remote/Tinkering/Optimazation
This fasttracks pipelines and shows broken pipelines as well for versions or hardwires by known editions.
Last Note a pill is developed housing nanotech which is polymerized/molecularized etc. (atomically engineered) this is used as a locator or other transitive tracking device or otherwise unspecified. Likely a food item or artifact or just anything (it would signify something anyway)--a pill. Or a small relief item.
==
IMO it can be used to correalate starNAV tracking with a DYSON-WARP-MAP or simply Warp-Grid which handles all timespace within a localized vicinity or region, 
and that would be trackable and transversable with all transcodes necessarily automatically applied and "anticipated" 
and this would occur as a LOIC-tokmac which would also be used as a stargate but let's just say that its first of all a pillform-concocted optional item (to allow free-travel in region and no clip access as desirable/indefinitely for owners)
Ready To Code Now (Still Need to Update Extras but then Its Ready To Be Built)

12/01/2023
Ballistic Code and Munitionable Proudction (Including Batteries due to explosive nature and empowering factors)
Battery Acid Pod Production--A podbay full of auto-generated battery acid designed to function as a pwoer rinse (and fufill all power grid needs)--is supported by auxilliary podbays--a full podbay reactor that produces battery acid and stores for use.
Converted Field and Frequency Coding and Application Modules now can run with battery acid-projection for gpu-support (form under frequency of battery acids and extend lifetime of battery supply)

So you also know, just dont like go using this to start cryptowar-fare or actual warfare or actual hostile anything:
Ballistic or Wartimes Testing/Data-Transfer (literally a missile Sabot shot)-that has been technologically enhanced to be handled(or not) but its receiving target)-which(could be a deterrence mechanism or combative artillery)--depends on how you use it really):
battery supplied target painted sabot (allowing for shield tensor pinpointing and transference of a rail-projectile)--over long distance or even port through (laser assisted if necessary)--shield decrpytion/shield penetration charge) able to trasnfer material(data encodeD) through a shield and strike target contents depending on launch/port trajectory and orientation)--easyballistic

I dedicated this work to one of my pets who gave me plenty of support and confidence while I had just had been finishing everything. Thank you very much.
Things have been going very smoothly despite a few open-speculations, everything has worked out better than I could have expected, I will miss him very much. It is a very bittersweet notion.
