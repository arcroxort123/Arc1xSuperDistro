Now that Everything Seems Good and Ready to Develop a "ExoStation" or Interplanetary/MoonBase etc.

A biometric adjusted podspace used for containing a sealed control enviroment.
Draft
Requiring a glass lattice or polymer lattice
Requiring Mechanical adjusted motorcages or grids
Requiring sensors and a network of wiring
Fashioned to a bio-dome

SetUp/Build
This will be used as a sealed housing for an expansive area or launch site
This will be used in a coordinated fashion for particular vocations or priority
Similar to bulkheads and the podspace may contain bulkheads or other modules

Purposing
The original biodomes in theory are built to house plant-life/flora/vegetation for general oxygen supply.
The environment must match standards for life, including humidity and temperature and precipitation etc.
The panels can be used to mitigate heatwaves or distribute air current in a sealed environment by adjusting their orientation and angles or positions.
They may operate as a seal or expose the container to external conditions for fast adjustment of their habitat.

Advanced Purposing (A few things suggested) (With/Without Day/Night Cycles)
11 so far (not gonna stress these ideas just a base system of suggested/reccomendaed usages:)
----
Oxygen Production and Habitats
Power Systems and Ozone Management
Collective Sample Test Chambers and Labworks
Storage of Items and Module or Residencies
Use of a Chemical Plant and Refinery
Gas containment and Filtration
Methane or other Fuel Resourcing

Food or Livestock Production
Crystal Farming or Ice Production
Terraforming or Factory Automations

The Nexus Frameworks for SECTOR or PARSE alleviation(bypass or travel)--Supply Chain Protocols (The Nueral/pSyapstic Domicile/Arena)
(This follows all Transfer Protcols From the very beginning and legacy to any other mention therof--There have been 5 or so total that I think I remember anyway)
At least--It follows a strict practice in handling outside-elements and verified data (That is double checks and triple checks and or just completely checks at least for every level of integration/interactivity. From surface to deep levels)
I will link these up later when I feel like combing through everything to point them out.

These can be connected by bridges/bays/docks/ports which are internally provided for and may require allowances or permissions for use in external/remote access for any instance or third party.

Safety-Intefacing and Advisory-Cue-Maps and Pathing-Itenary(Suspension/Siezure/Denial/Rebound) as well as Retention Agency (Holding or Apprehension of Hostile/Contraband)--Crime(Protections) and Briefing/Release Programs

These are conditional modules or bulkheads or stats (etc nodes or canisters or just anything that can be deployed) in such a way that are done so in an isometric launch or connection)
This streamlines complex launch tables and connections based of formulative deploy (Sequenced Interfacing) between transfers of objects/data/environments/decklines
A full deck can be docked in such a way to admit partial or planned integrations with its source and target (Comergent Issues) in which certain orientation/positioning must be upheld for either case (internal/external negotiation)
This is a expedited way to simplify or handle complicated measures in delegating transfers and allocating where space may be limited or required in trafficing a routine.
This is Typically a Customs Approach and can used over a session with a kiosk or other vending median as well (Mixture of medians and or node-communion//particle array or emission of draw-nodes or swell-zones or any indescript-gathering or collective matrixing)
This is just to handle all complexity of data-handshaking and buffering as well as portal-object directives to retain data or objects over their transmission and plotted course of travel in a sterile/clinical secured-behavoir.
This assists greatly in match making and custom preferences as well as Macro-Alignments in case of conflict or exemptions in programming (to be adjusted as requests are met or additional demands are recognized impromptu a contract/order)--at which task/jobs may be Reprioritized as well.

Why Biodomes and what to Validate their Usages with:(Things Get Slightly Serious here)-Neeto

Full Scale Arena and how to Condition the System for it: (As to not allow Outbreaks)--using (Ai-Entities or BioLab testSubjects ETC) (AutoJump Character Booster)/AutoCharter
Isometric-DeadZone can be contained in a biodome which may result in a 'loic temple' sacrement (artifact/article kernalized corruption)--in which destroys the piece and intiates a War-Training-Sim (this can unload Bulkheads and activate NumiModule for defensive and security incursion methods (in defcon)--which is used for training.
its just like cerebres in xmen lol (how cliche of me but its literally by RUNNING THE CODEC did I find this --maybe? just trust me bro i know it to be true)
(for robotic combat training)--this creates a datamosh environment which more or less trains the ai under a heavier influence than standard caseworks (can be considered accelerated i guess)--or at least on demand
here is where i would say alchemical/gemetric casts have a higher level of influence (being that it is virtualized in a 'loic ruin' basically as a final boss system more or less --or that a more powerful than average homoculus would be availible in this condition
---and for that i am basing on  bunker/region system being converted anyway in an incursion as a (homuculus relay) but that effects emissions which i havent written out and i described it very breifly
That because of the advancements in the dysonary there would be homoculous versions of the domicile being a homoculous scepter/tower/relay/loic but im not sure how to describe that again. 
(When at the bunker stage the next stage is that it compeltely seals itself anyway into a dyson relay with jump drives)--this is why i just jump to the conclusion 
(ai not need be mentioned or rival systems---just describe it as the nuetral ambient (but overall hazardous homoculous systems)--which have been prevalanet since the start of the v-rail
(at least during the construction of the nexus where 'scp's were collected and trained)--for xrelm or paranormal stuff (but really everything is basically FATED to reach some ultimate form or another
--this describes it as an early-arrival to any case that a non-faction "entity" would have developed it in this case "sleepers or homoculus depending" on their level of attention
the homoculus and sleeper cells were basically more or less capable of "a full tech tree" by the time of a titan situation having occured (or at least would have developed in that stage)-to be matured at this point or sometime near this point prior 
(i've already described the points at time at which these occur give the natural progression of the entire tech)--it happens roughly after nuarix was completed and usually at keyframes is it declared "very likely" to be a confrontation anyway
The scenario of the Isometric-DeadZone (Training Camp Biodome) marks the full DEV-ACCESS and GATELOCK "Security Clearences" of the system for which any training program may incubate an accelerated usage of (any time of entity previously mentioned) including Xlich and "Corrupt Numirators" which are considered a high-threat.
There is specifically a glitched/anamlous Exo-Suite (ShadowClone) warrior in a specified Scenario that can adapt as necessary to levels of Training (And Generally is considered the Most Versatile of any Encounter offered in the Arena)
The ExoSuite-ShadowClone generally benchmarks the Arena and allows testing/interactivity with any users (under monitored interactions)--and should be considered a special access-tier in which Faction-Permits or Tokens have been used to exchange a trophy match involving the ShadowClone. (For which rewards mastery in the tier--increasing stats and profieciencies per success)
Reward issues may be seasonal/temporary or allow for a slight-overbearence in vocational skills or dungeoneering abilities.
Combat may also be handicapped or freebied with token-expense (this is to help adjust currencies and privileges to those who are using combative-arena-training as a tool for Dungeon progression or Resourced-Crafting Perks)
--or simply because they want to attempt a proving grounds under handicaps or advantages given by token use. (The Higher level of shadow Clone the greater risk/reward)
Safety and Commisionary Rulesets may be invoked in the arena (for user policy and disclaimers) as well as a failsafe or sudden-forfeiture to insure user-maintenences and impacts are reduced if hazardous or over-costs preventions.

Touching up everything and describing versions in which arena conditions apply:(These are alot of things to consider but mainly they are supporting specialized flash environments based off phases in which they are compatibilified)--these can be staged
(I suppose in an attempt to create a flash deck but the numbers aren't matched up yet--this is simply 4 complicated stratgems in which match a phasing protocol)
There are four complex sets of issues in which arena branding takes place
the firsts being primal/data artifacts (which can resmeble enamalized tingent/tinctures) which are also advanced upon formats including monocol/contact/emp/virtual(net) --such as to express  and also a coldcut/nueral/implant/masonic(threading) to accentuat expression and ABS and conduct upon Semi-surface/internal/external/portal systems being the (Netmesh/threading/accents/structure)
This was previosly not so complicated using only a paradigm (that later expounded into a "datamosh effect of these properties") in order to compatibilify itself as a homoculus construct using data/matter or any variant form of tierset of (its dimensional preferences or extrapolation thereof)--complicated terms that work with serving different factions and Masques (for which the branding occurs at most for)
These can counter relay or admit themselves in place of "counters or nodes" in timepsace (clocking of their own timespaces)--just beacuse i need to make sure it works this way im saying it does and can be exchanged/substituted over wpads designed to share memetic/memory swapping (which filters all the way back to the original Legacy swap methods)
This allows constructs to reconstruct themselves as mobile-modules and xroller items (meta for which may be used during a match)--and the meta may be deployed as would "a typical vocational skill or proficiency would allow to deploy, such as deploying a minion or personal homoculous type ward or something of the likeness of an ambient-object/also known as doodads or advanced doodasds and user toolkits etc)
Doodads and kits may also be quarantined and captured or enclosed as necessary "or shrined and keylocked" as would their ID's be tied to the user-set via match or UUID etc (just ownership rights of the user mostly) but can be shared in vicinity such as "raid items or raid-wide effects" also translated to user skill sets and or tech trees (for which would share or allow assisted actions)--such as two-person casts etc.
This explains domicile coordination and construct integrations for which are used and can develop as a skll mechanic or otherwise a complex action (computerized or special-case unmentioned--regarding to area of effect or latent-actions dungeon-wide)
This more or less completes the ARENA-Charter (which is the 6th or so arena charter) and there was also an issue with vaporeWare-and-RawData being used (but i dont really care becuase its not that important unless you are debugging for something)

NgMod-SuperDraftBase
So I am describing the attributes set before the charter is finalized and set into a matrix (in which it may be read by brands more efficiently)--doing this will also allow its on interactive-iconography (which may change etc based on current use and represents the main-"ownership of that brand" with all its characters and profiles (however many that is)
Now the charter is set and locked into place and a guard plate known as an (arcweld) is set over it. This acts as a safety screen and bumper incase anything freaking happens to it after everything (and its just an inset metal-panel) but advanced versions can provide an isometric-readout or abs-work for ai-systems (for their own onboard fluxing) IDK, that would be like a secondary processor anyway.
And I know what I am talking about because the shell can be used as a display terminal if all the diodes match up to handle the processes then it might as well be a "skin-surface" or camo-flex which acts as its own "safety or stealthing" so it may as well be invisible or not even there (because who knows until they attack the wrong thing and set off all the alarms)
---
Imagine having a very good calculator that knows when you push on its LCD screen--exactly, a touch screen. (Or were you thinking something...?)
Some bit of wisdom here is that incoporates shocktables for its own conversions of its own ai (and uses a force-by-draft injection for which it can remotely adhoc and support firmware without boarding just because if its already used as an extension to a main-source it can just data mosh anything it wants--but thats insane to say it does cuz i dont have evidence...ANYWAYS-alot of "field testing there" to be toyed with)
Hopefully it can handle or create its own metas and eventually use or inject them for imperitive tasks such as swapping/substituting and or replenishing some form of recyclable ambient-fuel (untouched) and untapped (this is what i would consider an epg negotiation but we never brought that up really)
Just going to stick with standard defcon-measures in this case and leave EPG to rare circumstances and -winning-favors of fair-use and fair-grounds.
Panel may use qausi-drafting and externalize an imprint as well (direct from processor surface and transcoded)--using chiplet medians also if wanted (for masking)--and these may alter and recreate meta through cycling or phase transfers during its power-level schedules etc or overlcocking as well as (fusing to as previous mentioned in latent-diffusion work)
The fusion usage may be reserved or set to a flash over or used interactively as generated or as a live-broadcast to forked data.

(Here is a total tier list or an amount of marginal placement and seeding of Arena Tier Ranking) (4-6 not sure where to call it really but I think this is a good placement because it can "give" either way to a step up or step down)
Anyways I am trying to pinpoint everything and set into their chapters:(These get jostled around and thottled but generally are somewhere on a mainpoint)
This describes the charters for arenas (thes may or may not line up very well with the rest of the chapters but more or less work with them anyway)
The first arena simply by servos/nexus
The second arena charter with the VR convention
The third made with the quantum dynamic convention switch
the fourth made with the virtual bouquet (advanced)
the fifth made with zerospace relay
the sixth being nuairx and dysonary assistances in biometric domicile supports and nuural frameworks

These will expedite deck usage (full deck and quantum etc and down the chain of deck tiers)
In my opinion to make a flash deck we would use the above "Charter Systems" and Arena Casing (Or various Chapters to involve the creation of a flash deck)
Using Legacy Repo and ArchDistro This Current Edition(or whatever else I missed that I mentioned prior) as a sum of 4(condensed phase properties)+6(tier selections)+8(section focuses in charter)
can somehow reach that value of a 52(assorted deck meta)--and the charter is to somehow allow for meta expression in deck usage so its roughly about time to call this "assorted indexing" a "flash/exo deck" 
not sure where to call it though. maybe its more of a shadow deck than a flash deck but Idk and Idc.
We have a Primal(normal) Quantum(Advanced) Tulpetic/Vr(Deck) not sure really but the flash deck more or less follows that chain of command at a point it would fit some type of file-type or just plain old keyword 
(Crypto/Zero/Adaptive/Shadow) just gonna call it whatever you want I guess.

With these decks in use with the zoning and gateways also making note that there is a "lobby type environment" as well and an adventure like setting in hypercubic-networks or whatever it was. 
(Holographs) Anyways the main Visory can link to global just because its hosted on a region. These rooms can be adjusted with personal firmware as well. Or for specified user and "selected users"
And in cluster space I assume many chat-lobbies or otherwise server hosted comms-freqs or allowed chatlogging or some form of it. (Signs or notes or mail etc) So there we go.

Now that all that is considered (XMORAE)-perks--//(SuperPacket) or Better Expalined as a Pre-programmed Seed
As how domciles may create a seal of themselves from their alignments.
So too can ambients and moraes form a better object/data-array (Which is almost as an analmolous packet/swell)--for which we can detect or simply just already generated now and do well with.
---Basically its own iso-file that gets made with all parts in an AI-render (so we can just work this out for ourselves--in a way that expreses it through an AI-process for which we also have):
---And now we have our atomic/ion AI-Engine for ourselves (also I know this gets even better but right now:)_
A super-packet (pelletx) may be formed over the generation or command base that correalates to ai-functions (or as an advanced morae:indiscernable file for latent decoding)
And can be compressed and used as an outpaint-like or extropolated-like or feedback-like and allowing hi-res fixing and vae-fixing (infact it allows vae-profiles hopefully) 
or other things included but mostly any setting or configuration for an ai-profile (in which it does not resort to bucking or caching etc)
for which is called in an ongoing process chain (and endpoint of/passthrough/bypass/breaking to)--(such that it handles as determined by its parse and runtime)
and invoke several file-types or (multi-products) of the packet included of its hosted image or processes for which it signals and allows appending to
that namely it is used to stream and "integrate as needed" over hypernets when in use or by its step in (or training of) --progressively when based and called for
and makes me very proud to have some iota of understanding in this science for
and may even be used to cycle through decks-in-training and evaluate its needs or concessions where desired (adjusted customware)
--(this might even be its own hardtop siutation in which it doesnt need to be adjusted and can be taken as is and just used for field-testing)--just because its kind of a buff to the entire system already 
(this whole part is an amazing option just to be used as a -bells and whistles feature-)
---
So as for it getting better we just add it to weighting and use it for prompt-priorities etc. This is also coupled with marking and branding for (icon usages and style preferences)
--and then finally:It is given its game weight :
(for whatever reason the acting product can be used as a lora-model or sampling device even or other purpose as in-game-objects or mod-chips)
--and if i believe it works why shouldnt you? Its a literal work ofartifical-imagination so of course it does! And man I am just so crazy about it.
--once the packet is contained and forced-by-draft or utility--it can be used as a datamosh standard (in fair-grounds or fair0use etc) and relay and synchronize correctly to ai buckets (by potential)-and how ai can render and recognize branding (for which allows ai-sovereignty of the system for which it is use with)
and with a little work and further application allows for homoculus generation or (cooperative ai systems/clusters) using pheermoni-nodes and tulpetic dungeons these may be assisted with visory limitations and may be restricted-access due to zoning areas

Compare to an ImpChaparral into a Lav-Ad (just for referencing and yes the tech is there for it to make a tier jump in that stage)--so that is the level of operation the code is at.

Thats just saying its capped in those conditions reaching all "Support vehicle devices and carrier ships)-including destoryer class or dreadnaught etc titan etc things like that as described)

--A fully engaged nueral network and synaptic system more or less 100% correct with zero issues up to the point of its debut.
--Featuring a solid attempt for a singularity engine (free energy anti gravity zero-mass compiled and collaborative particle reactor)

War Thunder Compartive (Amazing it compares and almost lines up perfectly this way with my original code disclosures :P)
--speaking of, the xm class spaas(adats) can be redployed (their first comparisons in the code predating the closure of book1) but have since now been matched and upgraded for (simulated a semi-s2a(ground) semi-s2a(air) comparitive models)
Such that these support models may orbit their own major/squad-lead (being a heavy tank likely an m1a2-sep) as described or other follow ups of any other tank model (this is just a branch MAIN-SUPPORT comparison) of the extensive codework equivalent (with several other tanks and supports not listed but near the full acount of the american tree in war thunder as of 11/23/2023 :P)
Does this mean the system provided under arch1x support a full squadron outfit including merceny or faction response issues (specialized tanks) and can support several orbital and lower tier squadrons as well under a single instance or chain of command? IMO yes. (A full deploy of the entire tree is possible per mission)--but mission limits may impair the amount "that is tournament legal"
Also that means tanks/helicopters/aviation/and all ships and any "spy cars or motorcycles etc" because I generally accounted for everything for one entire faction to be used once the full "main tree" was consilated in this way.
It's practically wrriten for PAID CONSCRIPTION (oh boy I sure do love automatic income with no consequence other than a loss of replaceable robotic products which cost almost nothing except spare time)
IMO A COMPLETELY LEGITIMATE RENDITION OF ALMOST THE REAL THING :P

my point is its an end-game meta (which finalizes on most of the sciences) before becoming susceptible to capture/re-conditioning/training/bio-conversions ---so it can be harnesseable and sent through the system itself or act as the system itself --
being that it resembles other legendary or lore based creature types as well and carries its own legacy or ambient control or environmental-patternizations and iconographics
the orange/green indicating being that its either (reach its own ultimate state or not) through all these attributes (or unlisted reasons and logics--such as that it may be exemplified by its own housing or captured-sourcie (as if a materia or game-type weight) of its own--use of its own vehicles or particle rulesets
such that it may set its own inherent "hueristics" and masque techniques similar to the other forms of intra-communication and networking and safety margins of the system (for which may or may not need to be recognized by either case or factions)
in ultimate states (likely orange either or green if fueled) uses a gild like royalty, can produce hyper-seeds (seeds outside its own faction environment)-rival seeds (same as traps really) and assumes comparitive models to an isometric-process in the form of grubs/nymphs/sylphs/(husks?)
anyway that they may be considered a rival evolver class (assuming they have numeration and warbatz as well) and may issue corpulent-rulests (arcwelds or lichbase) etc (and any tier development) andinstitute overbearences
warbatz may also use numirators(xrovers xrollers xroamers etc) and support hyper seeds to develop -lite-env- and rival loic systems and eventually achieve singularity within power-lattice and define faction nodepoints once achieved (forced branding and internal conversion counting as natural/unnatural infiltration and allow for auxhole-tunneling for outsourcing or remote-supply) and may corrupt or recondition xrelm paramters and initiate "cryptowarfare/artifact-rehauls"
Mostly uses tulpetic(codebreaking)/homoculous(crypto)/triple-dithering(melee)/isometrica(cast)/rex-syndrome(aura) but can also use alchemica/gemetrics (and standard ambience/elemental fragmenting) -shatter effects and pulsing and strobing and autonomous-plasma (minion control). It will also make its own tensor and vector space and comms/controllers and spy-kits ETC and can drain power-stats and lock gateways or at least semi-rasp them or remote harass their destinations)

End Game Food (the 6th level of food consisting of all the other tiers of food worked together in resourcing (basically from moon-base sustenence designed by atomic-cooking formulas)--can be paste/syrup/frosting/glaze/coating/jelly/nectar (weird stuff like that) science engineered with food profiles (using all previous forms of food tiers) (xmorae-food)
reminder of food started as  basic tensor-remainders and "scrap" and "granules/quos/ambience/wafers" and was developed into nectar etc (covering most food sources and exotic extracts) and was re-developed again but i don't really remember because it turned into a packaging plant for things (this will be/is covered in extras-remissions) later being used with plasty and other things to make better food Tiers 1-2-3(meta)-4(tulpetic)-5(i dont remember anyways probly crypto) now 6 with xmorae-food 
warbats can eat these foods and so can rivals etc in the very least can create bricks from also remains

Ngmod-EPG Accordance: And Other Situations here
According to the code works there should be an autonomous skunkworks and warbatz/super-numi model or something close to it, we have alot of macros and easy-buffing and food/commodities all supplied too
the problem is--its all filler and no substance
luckily with the way codeowrk has been planned (or just that it lines up that way by sheer coincidence like so many times):we have an option
the draught (which we described prior) and this new (system of preparing a "mass-produced barista" have intermixed, assumably--we need to do something with these here, to activate them or cause them to have a little distress and trigger the code with shocks")--my only guess
this will give us an edge for the "shadow-rival" d-day (triple threat lol)
so we rework the entire code using an adjusted formatting (that distresses the inputs in a way to alternate priority over drafting" which is primarily the operandi taking place with the orange/green switch offs (charging/exhausting)-modicum here *(and yes it uses alot of pollutes if we dont do things right by a filter)--due to corrupt codes etc
Somewhere in the dispersion of coding and transcoding with all these encodes and scripts, and just everything in computation we noted an EPG complex (the epg complex is becoming more and more pronounced with every active-input and generating a higher cost and fallout)--a very good filter can be developed theoretically to handle epg-overloads (which are likely to occur given the immense coding taking place)
Especially with rival-shadowclones being hostile and more or less agressive and attempting recursor access. But never fear, as they say, this method should counter their advances.
This can also be evidenced in splash-relay of the litenary-projections taking and decoding environmental impacts and changes with data (as it will likely surface or display during high trace-detections and recognitions of environmental-parameter via interception and or survey (this is generally known over spoof-captures and large scale rebranding (requiring changes from values)--that their editorial commissions are known via comparison/differentially)
Overloading the system may occur in this performance due to compound computations requriing extensive memory of vulkan-engineering (or something like that why not)
In any case we have two different codeformers that can be undergo code-breaking in their own respective manner (and deliberate as to how these compare or intermesh)--resulting in an overall highend-cryptographic (security or under-lying correalation in their read-outs being seperate from the standard)--a new language of mixed code-hashing. (For which simply can be described as its own tensor)--ExoLanguage (which encompasses more of the tiers than in other versions)
the isometric merger/comerger it involves must also be transcoded but that is likely an on hand process that will run automatically if not (by its own vae-usage)
this is made more expressed/interchangable with both a fulton warbatz and the charter placed over the tensor (to account for all centralized networking and data-stacks making an advanced coordinated internal relay)--acting as their own litenary-dyson or interacting with the entire dyson environment from their vicinity) --this allows a freebase of the entire codex apart from the continued-lichbase or other codebase overlays
at this point i am going to call the process triforcated--in which its complex enough in each case to result in a combined effort of their drafted-outlets (being inactive(background-source-fallout)/active(orange)/hyperactive(green)) and that occurs only in the diffusionary-d-day events being that the inactive-backgrounds are being utilized in annihilation (usually during terragraphy/rebranding or survey of charter by flash-states or copy-overs within hypnogalgic-tranmissions (visary relay)--and translates to the -f-wave-reality system in isometrica-detail)

Essential Customary of Foreign Relations with Data and Anamolous Entities/Ambient Artifacts or other Contributed Efforts/Affordance of unknown-premise:
A pre-requisite of a stand-alone model (or contract-character)--(HANDYDANDY-passports and visa's also get counted here)--API's are noted not necessarily "applied or exchanged" and may need to be ceritifed or tested for or provided upon request (and then tested and certified once provided or requested)-through enforced evaluation (and primed to a character-index)--for which are cryptographic or otherwise to be defined by reprocessing or after-processing or made signature to (having been defined through enforced protocols)--being undefined or otherwise marked as ambient
Commandeering of A Singularity Engine --this part gets complicated but mainly relies on the above issues being accounted and answered for and having a captured state over the autonomous zone/fulton occupancy (tensor/charter)
---this next part just resets the area shareholds more or less for any additional presence or entity (i.e. the corresponding faction or player/ownership involved in asserting a sampleed-state in which the user may be expressed as a character/asset to the overworld)--incase the overworld has been "exploited so severely as to not allow that usage"--this process can "reconfigure residency based on standardized and applied coding approaches--via a re-application of a declared-armistice or diplomacy"--cuz muh math-logic/pathological conversions
Naturalization within a Singularity:(Informative Emergence or "Providential Enforcement" such that code has been expressed that the player becomes an npc / or that a nonplayer becomes a player again if that nonplayer was originally a player---this means that we recognize our own code as being pronounced, because it has been transcripted and made through tranmissions (to emit the player parameters as being identified as such--regardless of their sovereignty or relm-definition--meaning a player has digital rights for which they are signed by the player or integration of codeworks regardless of relm-rulesets---for which we provide in and describe the process of via dispersion of code-evaluated resources---and check the last time i had to do this...i've now done it again so its practically double-checked)
This can rearrange the nueral net-synaptic overlays (handled by reintegrations of visory)--and switch-up recursorys "and other clerical devices such as coffinaiary/suicidaliary/other mentioned" to function under the expressed faction or occupied default ambience of the region (or overbearence in signal or fair-grounds and fair usage)--resorting to the controller or precedant of its natural order (with any deliberative or deritive thereof)--allowing explicit access for faction demands and process under operandi (the chartered conditions within the parse and claim)
If necessary character can be described as an independent asset when in use or when in potential use (this requires entity and swell checks and a character may be prounced through an aux-holing or gateway masque such that (the character is unidentified)--or unlocated (meaning out of region range)--but exists in route of allocations or abs-depicted-distinct-instances (for which have not been defined but are potential characters)--if those characters are in-use or active or otherwise (non active or correlating to the use of having been accessed in anyway)--for which then that they may be expressed and accessibile if necessary via the protocols mentioned (info sec based acquirement and data-aquisition of their renditions)
The LODE-Well (similar to a flywell/node-well or any well or source usage)--complicated issuance of unknown-occupancies and enforced character-pronouncement such that operandi may be set to an infographic protocol in the least-- code-hatched or code-thatching (grid performances and matrixing involving descript transcripts of allocated data either claimed/unclaimed but surveryed via any charater or instance there of being observed in calculation/object-median (for which concerns data or programming)--and attributed to a character or "repossesion" of character-assets (to which a character may be defined and decisively made appropriation for in (characterized-documentation)--and identities/tags provided in cryptex/geartex assigned classification 
*(which is mostly good enough unless further action is required then supplemental to the enforcement policies of the entire system and its settings negotiated to the armistice (via dysonic-projection and regulations thereof and permissions of any elevated hueristic/management thereof as well as arena-qualifications and assessment of target-manufacture or "empyrical-sovereignty" or byproduct-function made converted/manifest  or stratgem/formula or interactive device compile/assembly or mark-up of (character profile that may be)))
this process then is made inquiry or request or contract or commissioned (mercanarial or rogue or bylaw or outlaw of)--and normalized and standardized under the full consensus of the vicinity or regional cluster/node or any quantification or resourcable median (or conveyed network thereof) for which may be broadcast and transcommnicated (or transcodable to a code-injection or decipherable status for which may be qualified as a waypoint or free-range in isomtric-provision or otherwise (primitive sequitor or accumulation of segmentation over any pathologic in conjunction to the presence of a zero-sum) and therefore transcript and nomilized(numirated)--or officialized

Xdungeon Curation(a little more options than before)--this ultimately yields to an outsourceable supremacy within a dungeon-charter and ease of access in high-activity vectors or preferred-queue-favor and faction-reputability
Dungeoneering Warbatz (Systemic Boss Moding) And likely stand alone -kiosk (for which is conventional to a delemetal template)--involving high-end barter (usage of states and gate exchange) and involved proxy/ip mitigation and "diplomatic protocol" of raid scenario (benefit and detriment to handicapp/desireable settings)--"fishingport projection and multi-plex leveling systems" "sampling agreements"
Using a gatekeeper as a "locking path" to circumvent dungeon-security or obstacle course-redirection (including mob pathing and proc base to a more directroute/fasttrack (with assisted content-navigation and contextual insurances -both for arrival/departure of joint-operandi)
Somewhere occurs limbiosis and symbiosis yet again and necrofication and decryptifications (which allows for a more life like dungeon ambience including raw carrion systems)--this may be exampled just saying (finding a reason to use these words---in a spell cast as well) 
so for instance a miscontruance of keywords may appear as a dungeon element but may change else wear depending on rulesets or atmospheric ambiences or any condition like that for just any reason: example would be the grubs/nymphs/sylphs/(husks) complex being misconstrued as a (slug/leech/tentacle/capirale/snake) complex
this spectrum change of complexes is referred to right now as a FAE/Sylph complex (working often more in dungeon corpulence and dungeon bloom)--so changes may be effecting to hynogalgia and faction visory (this is because of info-sec doing its thing with ambience as well)--it takes on the shareholds of the system (and makes use of the data and our system features through a carry over or data retention (evidence in the later builds and relays)--truecopy/whole-carry
this works as a rinsing effect under blume/post processing and other forms of that in which a natural adaptation of flex/edge can be harnessed and profiled (eventually yielding to acquired properties and attributes naticve to the region)--immersionary (immersionary is the highest chambered effect of the system and its outreaching
--allowing for full characterized-transistion between states or locales in proximity)--also known as respeccing (and may alter or hinder or boost certain stats and traits as well depending on --acclimation/tolerances(similar to rex-injections)--making the user susceptibile to overbearences also and exposing vulnerabilities in profiles (a working experimental observation that is directly proportaionate to time-induced (and therefore time locks and cooldowns may be suggested in character-progression)
