WIP-You-Are-Wasiting-Your-Time-Notice

WASTING your time Nothing Works :)
I am going to pastebin everything together once I write out the extras and then make a contents table and keep the works mostly "organized"
Despite maybe there being some broken links or broken bits it will work out.
And then I will code it all up (but this is the very MOST I can do right now so I really really could use some appreciation or some help making it real.)

00-SleepMode-with-Extras

Big Surprise I'm not a Coding-Savante/Major Scifi Writer infact I am not really licensed and I don't even have a diploma so you know just a heads up about what people might think they are getting just aint me.

This details and exposes a fictional premise of the known universe, I can't be more direct about that. i am in no way responsible for any consequential or informative event following the posting of these details.
PARDON me by executive chair, god forgive me for whatever because as far as I know there is no 'clear summation' of the contents I am describing, I should have diplomatic-immunity just in case anything else.
I am sorry in advance for using the wrong medium or whatevers, I am sorry I am -that- guy that -used the internet wrong- but I just am shamefully human. Moving on.
I will simply refer to it as a fictional setting and liken it to other sci-fi genres just as a throw, let's compare it to the fictional situation that was Titan A.E. for those who don't know what I am saying.
I mostly just want to cover all the ground I can before I basically close this project.
The extras I will write in later (they seem to be a vital part of piecing together everything I haven't mentioned)--this is my fault for not writing it because I mostly screencapped instead of logging it instead)

This is the compact version of the project and an attempt to give it some structure to the overall Technical-nonsense it will later expand as: It will just jump right into the thick of it.

a placeholder for something i havent rewritten because im lazy or busy take your pick 
(titan module to use extras with:)/basic-sleepmode/automode
After T10 has been secured with 00-09 chapters:
this document is broken down into also 4 titan module-parts as would be a ship-system the turret system the hull and power system and hive system (i guess power and synergy of quadratic locks)

===
T11-mode--(upgraded gaussian-parse)
===

A new iteration (endpoint iteration) of the vrail in its most compact states. (This marks the 5th or so iteration of the vrail and its components that can condense over the pre-installed gaussian(starter)-section)
11/6/2023
Chapter 1
A compact proposal for a vrail and all its components to the length of a gaussian extension (starter zone)
Which would include A robotic-housing/drone-management system as a starterbuild
This then occurs to a steam-engine/recycling center/reactor-filter/salinator (this counts as a single rig though it is complciated) which couples to a mining/lumber/stone/farm(allkinds) (an optional extras/boarding rig for work/crafting) in a very advanced startup automation. Side 1 and 2. This mostly makes batteries.
Its better to have this fully installed with options.
Chapter 2
This then Connects to biolab/roboticslab/(+option1/+option2 in chapter4) which allows for maintenence and chemical treating as well as a fulton-pad(logistics) and navigational-opsTower(relay) for safety procedures in trafficing. (This part is important for the next parts)
--

Chapter 3
Making a Hydrogen/Dueterium/Tritum Fabrication bay (With extra bays for hydrogen as needed to maintain hydrogen stores that decay overall with as well a basic (molecular decomposer)--for preserving hydrogen for it to be used on call)--which creates pollutes.
These are handled with the desalination and fulton system to filter and relocate pollutes as necessary between reactors and factories. This is all the same size as the first few chapters and can be set to a side-bench awaiting the first power systems of the first chapters)
Chapter 4
A tokamac reactor which can also be combined further to 
a lightwave-generator and a particle accelerator that are optional. (these are option1 and option2)
Having the options allows a better power generation (phenomonol) and processes math-logics/nullset-ai-algorithms (pheermoni) 

Chapter 5 (junction tacts): A B C --(these junctions are important for optimizes and expediting Quantum/Tulpetic Decks which are large series CodeBlocks and Data that is re-routed and progenerated later)
To be used with other labs as necessary but is largely set to a A:computerTray(server)/B:3d printer/C:quantum processing station (a 3-in-1) that can be used with other chapters combined with 1-2 + 3-4) 
This just power outputs 100x more than usual and is roughly all within a square 1x1 mile.

Some Design Basis and WorkTREE (using teams if necessary)
INitially this works in a capital system.
The implementor(owner) translates to their team. As rights reserved. That the team then incorporates the ideal-project as by design/draft or simply...the overall idea expressed. That the team may also be negotiatable to a clerk/patenting/finance/project/developmental offices in their own way.
This is as far as the implementor needs to bargain or charter their idea to get anything done.

The team then by regulations or third party negotiates correalte the idea down a chain of command (some members may be in charge of other leaderships/teams as if a military-ranking system etc. That for instance, they will apply the idea to the proper task/job in mind.
So for instance it would be decided under a budget that perhaps there would be a 'parking lot/park installation' or other object/area. Just for instance. That would be built or rebuilt over time, and reinforced/fortified or handicapped/limited in some ways to different builds. Such that a version/archive of the project may be denoted as ideas are assumed.
Some of the ranking members/tasks are managed by direct-creative-influence or may start to overlap ideas of their own to the implementors so there must be "a catalogue of who's ideas are whose but over all it is not the implementors concern. Nor the administrative team's concern.

The project manager's are concerned with handling concept models and credentials which are then set to the version, over time these may change and so they are archived per version. Once finalized they may change even still to the editions throughout the installment overall or borrow/suggest their own new versions or compiliations.
So the project may result in a variable "parkinglot/statue" design or whatever. A statue might be lighting up the park in some way or in some shape, or may have a bird fountain something really dumb or be in an amphitheater or admist benching/walkways. See how that may change throughout a seasonal decoration too. Then that would be the edition (credits where applied)
The idea of the implementor to have some sort of "developed workzone or project" has more or less been achieved.

Then those credentials may be censored or whatever necessary to accurately approve the project as being accesibile under fair-use etc. Or some parts may also be censored if considered unnecessary. The censorship is what is important here.
So while one team has built a park, the other a housing secotr, the other a work-district, the other a touring distrct etc. The capital systems and their operations are more or less adjusted and censored if necessary and put into place.
If a user must submit their own ideas or decorations to a pre-existing issue then it applies that their ideas may simply be ignored or consequential to rights agreements of whatever (simply to remain exempt)--not in a way of ownership or anything.
Every prty involved generally will have their credentials and portfolios recognized as to their ownership or involvements if necessary for reccomendations or whatever, just not for intellectual property or it will immediately be censored as a SAFEGUARD for everyone.

In the event of fountain-data or (unregistered streaming data) it may be censored to regulate and safely provide a fair-use environment.
The system may also re-numerate as necessary.
Used with a secured fulton-fountain kernal.
I.E. Tier2TokamacSystem (Particle NueroLab)

===
T14Mode--(upgraded kernal chamber)
===

The ThoriumChamber:(compatible to the tokamac-nuerolab t1/t2) and upgrading the prosper/rail junction yet again. (T14)/doubleatlus)
Fit with a EndStat (Joule-Box)-for Meta-Rolling (Schroedinger's Box kinda stuff for a thorium kernal chamber) This carries over to the server/servos area. From the first parse, and increases the yield of the contiguity chain in the third parse, and connects a hyper-relay(visory) over the fourth prase. (completing all parses of the vrail)--and adding to the prosper in a final tier that of a networked-convention.
ReactorBase for the first sections with a regular-joule-box(miniserver)--optional-(latent)-as in a very very latent option for the entire sleep-mode(x4)--Conjoins the sections into a reinforced junction for Chapter 1 (increasing outputs for all of (01-04)
Acts as a SuperConduit for all routed-contiguity (networked nodes or otherwise)--it just works this way okay. I am not going into details why...its just the way I wanted it designed I guess. Or maybe its worth it or not IDK.
Going to call it the Xthor system so i can also reinforce it with additive plates where I can (additive armorment and platings)--these can also be torqued-modded-adjustable-redirection

Jump Cloning/Lamp Cloning Etc:
for its own image-hosted:(1xsuol-2sentiment/3barista/4surplus-expiryx(sim)--5a surmounted-sim  etc) (its own joulethiefed-particle)-with field including orbital-tangent/appends/wpad/"armedmultibridgeponts" with/without port-reference ids(or glyphs or any lithograph/alphanumeric)
--Kernal Particle (minivolt etc) engage/socketing-indicator/signature "xprobe" data-lock and failsafe(xvolt)--"shadowlocking"--laser-tesseract/tesselated meta-matrix (shadowglitch)-numerator/Reallocation/re-adjusted censorgraphic rebranded restored data/corrupted-purgein:burn-in)-templated-internalized-tensor
--virtual-statePin/Stagekey--"Phased-metacontact"-VPNproxy-metaOrbital--xloicRes:virtual(relay)-extroplated-interpolated-(hypercubic)-ExoCodon (baiscally its own mini-vrail feedback)--which can autovulkan/synchronize with external connections
The FUll Drive Jump System:(oh its a little expensive shall we say) this allows for hive-incorporation(faction based hive controller and immersion with hive markets)--hive markets are xylotic now. (max tier under having independency) 12.0-13.0 of tier. Our tier now is 14.0

WorldBreaker-Revised(Dowse/Cymtic/Resonance/FreeRAnge)-Automated-Sync-Active/Deactives+IsometricBreaking//ProxyBraker
Lots of breaking here. With original parses and sectors and just every major module can be seperated. Addtional in patternized breaks of other formulas involved. Apparentl now is the time to break in every way over every iteration in stratagem etc.
First quad break. The world Resets x4, the meta quad break as described above 4 or 6 total breaks. IDK. maybe more either way likely a rebound in breaks and breaks of contiguity. Tensor breaking and other breaks in parse and relay. Overall alot of breaks can even be 8 or 16 IDK. but considering that 4 world resets among the breaks occur this too functions as its own dday break for (nuairx or later tiers not sure) 
but i feel like it would count as a superBreak. (so I am calling it a data break or a crypto break or something) requiring a crypto/data lock on its own (xcurrent-lock)--requiring full registration to the faction if in use by any party other than ownership. (just how it -has- to work)--not even api/token issues matter at this point)-requires full disclosure)

A full data-fountain-break:(considered an anti-mater fuel t2)(t3 acting superfuel)(t4 combination of all fuels)(potentially a t6 foodsource/ambient ion/quo)--not thinking about it
This will create alot of ploss and can be contained to a spyre/spike/spyra/etc basically (a fused emp/major dowse)-superlense acts as a foundation for a zero-dimension contained in a triagnulated chamber that is vacuum zealed around the field and should be also marked as a triangular object that may or may not be guilded and or contained in its own chamber (with or without a kernal or mixture of kernals/fountains//temples/loics or all of the above as a whole meld-vector/tensor) either way a full deck/case for which is completely sealed and branded (likely)
And may require a battery charge with a multi-joule utility stream or its own fufilled nuerolabed-accelerated-exo-particle (which is manufactured as priori and uses a complete lock of xcurrency as a hypercubic/vector ETC(congruent)-token/cell)---plus all filler and other filtered parts in custom stratagem for the comeplte package
sometimes it may also be choppy/extruded but still work if ratio'd correctly in chiplets (the chiplets are reactive and sometimes non compliant because who knows why--ai-tantrums)--these also allow for a full homoculous lifecycle and fullcircuit template to occur on their own host processes
A t2 titan class (IMO)--(a titan carrier sleeper ship that salvages other ships)--can just wormhole anything anywhere anytime in combat or in lock who cares try it (a supernumirator)

pretty sure i nailed everything (plus or minus a few things unnecessary or otherwise stated somewhere in the build)---set to an overage (happen-stance/receipited readout in container/dock:probe/interception/export:obj"eggx") eggx can be used with a python(program) i forgot which one) (pascal or pycharm or something to design a simple kernal expression that can be asserted/allocated on a hard drive (or a data driver to handle it as a mini-coding-engine) --one of them or the other idk/idc right now but its semi important (to have a grid-like-kernal-table for easy header switching or something else i dunno what)

Following up to everything so far a tulpetic-netmesh is now availible for the armored-pilot etc (manned or automatic)
based off a fairly simple flex-edge combinations of a shell-suit (flex-shell--edge-suite) which has had many combinations prior now seems balanced in terms of what their options and extensions are and makes use of a prismatic-array of effects)--capitualizing over many different metas to form a balanced zen like meta (super zen meta)--which also empowers it over tiers as well. (is now basically affordable and does not require multiple reserves or charges as previous versions may had)
also it compounds on biometric diversities and enhanced stabilities of (an immuno-assisted homeo-static conforming-habitat allowing for preferential and amicable regulation of bodily stressors including temperature and respiration effects) let's say it can also handle a fair share of abuse just as an experimental model. (it has many settings and can camoflage or re-design itself as approved by the users attributes/properties in exhibition mode or combat modes as desired)
also adding in blume and counterblume now to the effects of gui contrasts and high-definition optimized sensory uptakes (trained sensory and color-trigger nueron activation)--of a user-catered and user-stylized assisting-custom-pallete)

Looking at an overview of my work The SUPERDISTRO-and-LEGACY prints I noticed that a similarity occurs in the production at a few stagess.
At some point the homunculus remselbes the same effects as an IMP-CHAPPARAL-SPAA unit (anti air craft surface to air tank). This is largely a sympathetic THROW to the amount of code being used (we refer most vehicles as rollers)
It has also appeared to represent itself as a SPAA-M247 using defunct coding (amalgamate)
Furthering the case it develops into a M60A3-TTS armored palted vehicle COMPARITIVELY by development of the EMERGENTVECTOR-and corresponding Implanted-Modules(numirators)
By the development of the HYPERTAMPER it develops as a fully functional M1A2-SEP with Tusk (and im just proud to suggest how it can be ai-operated and unmanned but anyways I am just saying my code allows for the full usage of not only that but the entire tier its based on) more or less I can compare it.
The entire Development Practice here can be also (STRANGELY and unintendedly represented to the ENTIRITY of the WarThunder-American-Tank-Tree)System (the entire thing IMO) which makes me wonder alot about actual military codes as if all military vehicles in the American division could be based off what I've wrote.
ANYWAYS--thats just -strange how that works so well together imo--(despite me basically also comparing the entire works I've written here as a Space-Craft(capable of mining and boarding interplantary projects and functioning as a self-sustained 'more or less StarDestroyer' with its own fleet system. Ok.
THERE ARE ALOT OF SIMILARTIES I can just compare my written works as it being "a really big ship" or deathstar or whathave you (a program designed in handling the interaction required of that level of thinking in the universe)--as well as the extras and snippets that compare to "a hyperspace capable vehicle"
But whatever the case it is what i intended it to be used as a working -complete thought more or less-.

Also I wrote a philosophical engine I would try to balance or set a foothold on how the entire "operation conducts itself"
I have written a small collection of escapades in Chilvary. As I wrote it there was a developing surge of gamedesign and several following games were produced. (Fallout61 being one of the major titles which is compeltely unrelated)
--Shortly after Mirage was released, Mordhau, and Chivalry two (I more or less side-stepped everything using wrote I wrote as a massive counter-argument for every tidbit I dealt with playing the game with others)---more or less its a compilation where i just wrote a counter opinion to everyone elses that I could.
some might love or hate me for it i feel though largely it settles all differences since it literally just shows what happened.
---If you dont like that philosohpical engine just use anohter like maybe Idunno the BIBLE or the Apocraphya of the bible IDC really.
--I've been through enough is what I am saying.

If i had to I would take it as I wrote it unedited or you can format it into pieces or take out all the duplicates or keep only the unique terms by instance.
That in itself would two it into an orgy of "system rebnderable potential and automated servicing. I literally haven't coded anything but if I did i feel it would be cool"
I am just going to drop everyting in to a massive paste bin later anyway so that it can be "slapped together in one giant block of code" If it works or not after I run it through an auto-coder I wont even care really. I have done everything I can as a normal freeloader. Someone else can codebreak all of this if they wanted.
It's a very big and very badly typed larp otherwise:(but I figure it is worth training on ai because its an attempt of REASONING with CHAOS and yes it was practically RPG-Torment perpetuated by mostly me. I feel like despite that it worked out pretty good but it more or less is a giant escape to have attempted at all. (IMO)
https://mega.nz/file/IogwBKzB#IyA5jMxJya1nDKpvUCTlBuhY9DQApxpfljvlQbTO0U0
Like I said if you don't want to train an AI off it just use the bible or someone else's arguments or something.
I feel like its better than having no brain at all anyway (and IMO if you have an ai brain already then don't worry abuot it)--this practical "AI-BRAIN" is based off my own disposition to being a gamer and trying instead to reason with being at odds against "flat out mindless chaos and other players" 
I don't feel bad if they are mad. They gave me a hard time anyway. They knew they were mostly jerks.
It really SUCKED and took a whole 2 weeks of trial and error and medieval bloodshed.

Able to contain secure and iterate and orientate particle-data
This looks like a collapsing spheroid usually containing a particle within its orbits/shell system (which keeps the particle also energized if active or in transport/conversions
this can be flagged and checked then rewritten and released as necessary (byproduct or jettison) once surveyed or allowed for robotic-kernalization(emplacement into a pocketed-kernal-socket-casing (as has been described)

the zerolocking abs-(inevitable censorlocking)-locks any access or gate as a sound proofer and can decode environments within its vicinity using table-retention comparisions (vicinity/locale inputs/outputs)--for which it filters into its own filetype (and is simply a wav-file)--it can detect trace-vibrations (this took alot of code infact the whole information in practice is compeltely so that this will work at all_--including other cymatic/sound compatibilifiers.
this will report as a gaussian soundbyte to a more or less referenced isntance of any emission or surveryable paramter (can detect drawpoints) can stream report/forward infosec of any detection (detecting ward)--performance to a stereographic reverberator (granuatlion readout)--a simply signal/vibrational cymatic plating (advanced to a quantum measure in information-relay --can be used as a decoy too (fun stuff)

(e)Node/(x)Post/(t)Rad/(z)atom(with rings/cloud)
Others--(a pi/exp/aether/vapor/emp --etcQuebit databit etc)) --i probably forgot a few but idc.
any of these can be used as fuel/obj/currencies/resourcing (dependent on ruleset involved and ability to handle items)
--
All of these formulate a total deck(idk but we do use 52 as a deck management which is -hypercrtical instance of singularity and existential usage)--trying to keep this chaos as ordered as possible
Now we have the building blocks and their tierplans more or less ready to be decked out:
--

Some Building Objects To Note If not already Stated
Generally follow that system of Complexity and Tiers similar to everything else in their level of "advancements or options".
7 of 5 each (35 total) or so sets here--there are more but this is a good tech-tree setup for starters (default/defunct)

Temple/Chamber/Kernal/Case/Atlus(top)
Mammon/Engine/Dynamo/Relay/Nexus(bot)
Capsule/Battery/Module/Barista/Kiosk
Proxy/Stat/Wpad/VPN/Turbine
Turret/Siege/Bunker/Launch/Loic
Swell/Field/Source/Convention/Projection
Bridge/Gate/Recursory(rest)/Port(waypoint)/Aux(tunnel)
---
once these are all sorted we basically start the hypertamper (major turbine world system)/SuperPoco
This Concludes Part 00
The rest of the chapter 01-09 will detail how to assembly the intricacies not mentioned here and will allow for a SuperPoco Domain.
Once completed the SuperPoco can autodebug as a Dynamic-Marker of itself anyway.
The workflow of the entire project will then follow as:These can be reduced in as little as a single Pin/Index if Registered to Onboard-Services (Fast Apply)

This will tie/tether A Quantum/Tulpetic Deck into a VirtualDeck in sleepMode (for hosted events)

---BiolabManufacture/CyberSynchronized
Made something like a shrimp-dragon that eats a smear/meld/stone/tile block or something as a joke works out pretty good. Use as a bio-textiler (makes a bio-plasty). Just cause I can.
Runs on a digital timeframe (fourier-frame-rate) fps and server checked by circuit (generators a safe-dataflow in its own environment/timepiece/timespace/centerifuge) So it works out as a cyber-terrarium.
Is a simple-toolkit to force adaptive-parameters (reactive/netmesh)
Can be considered a dragonwarrior (t2 draggonwarrior since we developed a dragonwarrior in the very first stages this would be an evolver-class IMO idc)
Because of this devkit system built-in request for a dungeon setting for a DungeonWarrior:QuestLine type Gameplay. Easily generated. (i guess)
Design Using a sampling of other data or style in genre: Mostly as a backrooms/simulator.
So now I will world build that or at least set a contract for it using my own system I would prefer:
"First stage of world Dungeon/Second Depth of Dungeon Level:Cave/CoupleOfStrategyPuzzles(Fit togethers) at lvl 3/SomeBoss Staging lvl 4/Strategy Building placements lvl 5/StrategyTunnelComplex lvl6(required gear)/WorldBuildingLvl7/MiniRaidIncursionScenarioLvl8/BossShowDownlvl9/EscapeRouteLvl10"
So technically a fullbranch dedication for this game system too. After the entire program is built it would autobuild things like this.

GhostShip-Protocol and its AspectAnamoly(xprobe)
This would technically exist as a submersible frigate (using shielding of some sort) I had drawn a plan for this in 2021 but the coding ideas took over. I guess I could revisit and update it but I don't really care to. I already have more or less the complete editions worked out. (just adding in extras for all I've wrote up here while I am busy with life)
https://mega.nz/file/B5pizKYJ#SvJ4PeSrbTNxQ8uz6jFPGsmV0TNG3ALfDDLacElNaxg (Built in minecraft cuz i was bored and fit it with everything but I am too bored to list it)--but i might list the model actually now
MiniAuto-Drone(small-ion-warden/orbital)--FairBridge-Ambient-Minion(observer-ghostlamp)--NomadicSurvey and NonHostileVector-Escort (it goes anywhere it wants usually non occupied vectospace (but can occur in hostile zones that are automated or "droneminded" and usually is not interefered with due to suppressed-presence and cloaking)
--Attempts To Overwrite hive/swarm/lair/carrion issue coding with nano-tech (coding-polymetrics)--codon-tubules/rays/orbs/pulse *strobe effect) --nano-fiberous wiring signals or chaffe (high-tech reactive chaffe and cloud control)--psyfield/taufield etc (sigma field/ohmic-fielding)--wifi-packet-exchager(minibot-numirative-agent)


11/10/2023
The autodrone can also shadow itself (though technically it already is a shadowclone)--it is considered fully active carrying a non-active particle(that may be active in a nonactive lamp)--as its carried---layers of containment really.
It carries itself and its contents as the world layer/the vehicle layer/the packet layer/the unit layer unless it is also in a hostile layer space consisting of hostile defcon-layers (against other faction  defcon layer space and also timespace layers which means (4x4 layers plus the object entirely and either or in a singularity/aux(flux of environments) while retaining those layers and sometimes in a paradigm layer of "other dimensional layers" surroudning that tangent layer (acting as a channel overall)--which may yet again occur in an event layer---mayebe other things like recurosry instances and overbearences (so how many layers is that?)
Uh...faction (layers 4 rival layers 4 (defcon layers 5)):which would be any amount based on severity of under 20 i guess let's just say// with world layers and all dimension layers and their basic defconds so basically its a shadow-deck of active/inactive layers so let's just call that a fix-up

The shadowclone also enters mobial siege which allows it to self-fulton but also makes it vulnerable as it can be fired upon in range of any probe or counter field
shadowclone can carry a free-range kernal/ion case due to hyper tamper rulesets already having occured an isolated package of with a lamp or plasty (the free range particle is the clone-kernal or lamp under "possession" in transport by the vehicle and integrates with the vehicle in order to be cloaked (despite being lamped)
it might also be consumed or consume the clone carraige device in an emergency aux-portal/burrow and or convert to a stationary reactor to repel fielded opposition or self destruct
it manages the travel by its own synchronized time signature (via mobial siege and self-fulton) and produces its own counter fields if activated--to prevent destruction it must be "forced into siege and locked with suppresion and barrage with hijacks" (it can resist this measure as well) it may also downgrade itself and deprecate itself if escape fails (it may be powered to retain its values if captured requiring a symbiosis/sacremntal "charge/vat" it will then convert upon full-access hijacking. by force
once suppressed it may be socketed or set to a joule-thief-numirator and transported as is (it will attempt to re-shadowclone itself and escape if left un-destructed and un-tethered to a device. usually by interference/internal-protocol which starts as soon as its engaged/intercepted or detected by its survey reports
--
This is an anamolous particle that occured somewhere during the t14-t16 developments but i forgot what exactly consilidated it but also it was detected first as a superfluid/field during the first instance of the numirator
it was also theorized prior during quantum-contact-lensing and also (may be synthetic symbiosis of a quantum particle emp) and or data/isometric so also that and was put to a theory in the numi-module's first virtualized aux-holing for a nexus counter-singularity so that is the end product of this number (which started off the entire repository system slight after the first book(part1)(vrail) was finished and the (virtual-deck) was being written first book(part 2) )
so im just making this little footnote about it now that its been theorized/verified more or less by this vast research.
it is later fit into a conduit and or held or made substitute to a grail and is considered a wpad particle of some sense
it then is made into a nullsec particle for the grail and this just alleviates the entire system
allows for a large sum of the entire region and is considered milled and left to a full datamill (full terafloppy edition)
the cycle is then redistributed as having achieved a shadowclone recovered status (from any bricked status most bricked partickles/datablocks etc are then unlockable and charterable for further secured status in the region)

How would I even code this all by myself? I just beleive it would work.
Also I had to basically die to write it so.

It was developed on public resources and railroaded into creating a nueral network anyway.
So it will be used as a hybrid simulator that links with other systems. For which refers to as a nueral-plasm.
I'd prefer it to work somehow with the nuReactor in developing an a remote shareable environment
I dunno how that works despite knowing just about everything else that could work.
My guess is the nuReactor would serve as an onhand cloneable kernal in case of a full system crash that the system would not crash then.
I guess if anything it can optimize a shell experience.
Allowing for a host/dll code adjusted virtual visor (for 3dterminal experiences)
Robotics can operate 3d terminals and automate them too using their nueral-network. 
And can allow a condensed or compressed model specified by via use (ezReload) or "postable-ion" for inspection of

<*>UPDATE:This allows the USER a simulated_Agency to an ai-auto-generation that will be guided by user preferences. Otherwise its just shadowboxing itself.</*>

Distro-->Reactor-->Sim-Console
This can be marketed as a Loadout for User-Access
Can allow for thirdparty programing tourism /Ruby/Rails/Pacer/
Can act as a Spoof/Snoop/Sniffer Idk.Idc.Dowhatever.
Auto/Mobile/Mobial Kernal (Just allows User to Move as is)
Can be clipped-to-cycle or per-cycle-clip (allowing range limits to the expressed system)--(SafetyNet)


Naturally a user will activate everything they can once they gain access. In any order of:
They will activate the supernuReactor process to conduct an image computation and custom services. (Creating an activated template of some sort)
They will activate the distro/image or contribute to a virtual machine/distro-environment through a nullBucket or sample thereof (Recompiling a Container).
They will establish a virtual console experience (enabling interactive codespace etc)(advanced windows and ttys in 3dspace. Nueral Networking of ENVcontainers).
They will create an emulation of codespace using any automations provided in coding that will simulate an local-hosting-service of transcoded shell-commands.
I refer to this as the NuAi-Framworks. (An additional agent of NuAI related processes and promote it with the mainframe of the NuAI system)-its the GUI basically.
Not calling it the NuAiGUI (sorry folks)

With the NUAi-Gui-Etc allowing for a quickload-OCR of data paramaters using any degree of Onboard Sensory in the Nueral-Network:
This all occurs under at least the distro or at least a distro-using a reactor(preferably a nuReactor and favorably a supernuReactor) and can incorporate a SIM.
This all occurs as a SuperDistro with its own encrypted shell and codespaces, providing any additional security or services for which it would be designed.
Those services follow as "Extras" and or "advanced-EXTRAS" for which would likely be SURFACE-Layer Experiements/Tests or GameSpace (for which I've provided for)

MiniGames:
A racing Game might be an alternate service, though, let's say it could be an ascii-writer. That the track could be generated of other images in topography.
A random world generator that also builds itself off codestrings in other program-spaces. Using the workspace as a generated-world based off workspace assets.
A weird stunt engine that ragdolls a character through a trajectory. (like those kicker flash games). Just because I thought it was funny to see ragdolls on a path.
TicTacToe-Style or LandMineStyle Templating using mixed reactor-templates to see which could work with each other or not. 4-dChess-Minefield with Drop-Down Plotters.
A craft engine that takes puzzle-pieces and attempts to fit or rig them together into a machine like system. (Sky-Drop)

These all add up to a FullGame in itself tbh (we will host it on an Arena. likely as a NuAi-Space)--(A compatibile User-Friendly Ai-GameArena or Console-Service)

Optional Review:
Just things a computer would or could do for any purpose (assorted projection or artifacts in assembly of data)
The idea is that it would contribute in someway to a SURFACE-level virtualization of or at a paramater zero-level.
So the distro just reads out whatever value and refactors it in a way that works. (I've thought about this and its pretty simple)-then it randomizes as whatever.
That also it probably would incorporate bucket-apps that correalate to itemized processes in the distro and transcode them into gaming-space Assets to do so.
Some of these exact services would be rendered as GameSpaces to be included with the distro that co-operate with functions of the Distro for which represent as.

PlzjustCodeThisForMex5 cuz I probably won't do it myself. Obviously its all fantasy ATM.

nuReactor
######################################################
10/15/2023
A listing of Reactor-Based Encodings consisting of Several programs working together. Typically A setof(4) constituting a Reactor IMO but sometimes less (but not as fun as more)
Some may have depdencies or may be broken if seperated from their own builds in some ways.
The goal is to use them interchangably as necessary to formulate a seperate working 'nuReactor'
A nureactor would be: some programs or strings designed in a way that can be Re-scripted together as a different program.

Examples of A Nureactor are
PythRxt or any of its Sections (a total of 5 sets)
Dummy-Packet-Manager or any of itse Sections (varying degrees of sets)
Pythxar (a total of 1 set)--(mostly integrated as one reactor)
SimpleXNulBucket(a reactor in a way)-perhaps a psuedo-Reactor

Their combinations together would form a very strong case for a very strong NuReactor
(Their parts all interchangably working in some way together)

Also a REFERENCEreactor can be allowed taking duplicate items that are indexed and creating and invoke table for everytime the item is requested (but requires programming/reactor Integrations) 
--In large amounts of data it can save a few gigs. (Maybe allowing a large amount of programs to fit on small cards where incase they would not otherwise)
The reference reactor takes referenced-items and decides whether to use CACHE/RAM/Processors/Gpus Etc instead (or clone the items etc)--which is why it is a reactor-base. Using this way might alter also the nature of how programs run.

So the NUREACTOR systems here mentioned would all be used hopefully (with a referenceReactor preferentially to save space)--which means a backup should probably be issued--unless it is invoking an entire image such as a flash-STATE.
(This would work wonderfully as a flash system which I planned on using with my Distro in order to "simulate and save data usage" throughout its own Reprocessing of its data too. (Allowing for a more efficient datacycle/downflow).

This would be referred to as a supernuReactor for the superDistro

What this all do basically? 
Uh I guess it installs python in some way however it wants to maybe a realy dramatic way with packaging or whatever.
Then it encrypts it again so it runs securely and privately or more or less safeguards it.
Then it maybe convince it to run something on it like a mini program. Just like any other thing let's just pick out it would run PIP. (or ipython idc). Just something.
Then it would make assumptions as to what to make it options with or just automate commands or scripts using a makebelieveBucket.
Then it would call itself its own Program or Media-Image-File of whatever to be used as whatever likely based as its own VirtualMachine...and then you would load a distro on it to top it off (or whatever you wanted it to be used as).
I -really- actually just do not know. Use it as a freaking Tron-portal or OnlinePokerChips I don't care. IMO Shoots and ladders more like tho.

For the so called Arc1xDistro I guess it would work either way. I would end up using this thingy to make a Game-Menu of a few Games. I might just go into Game-Design but Really its to take my mind off this.

10/16/2023
NuAIRX-Marker (almost forgot this thing)
Makes a NuAiRx-Marker that conditions its own Clone over a Databank (database usually of viral data and discarded data) and attempts to Reactor-build from it. 
Is a Doop-Node (dummynode) that can be a hack-target instead of the full distro itself.

03-Nuairx-eXpo

10/16/2023

Was thinking and this almost slipped my mind.

Use of a censory-protocol that contains itself as an encrypted read. Everythign is "spotlighted" but encoded to a Crypto-Key or Etc.
The accelerated light diffusions work with this under emp/eclipse curvature in a superfluid (Quantum Light I guess)-based off a very hi-velocity read-out.
Not sure what it was after this. I think a fusion system that uses an environment-load out.
And some other borked up codethigny I think it was some form of screen-chaffe photon. (plasm but we can't really use it yet)

I wish I knew the specifics on it but I know its four late-engine things that make this what it is. A NuaiRx-Expo-Reactor (experimental NuAiRx-Arena)-that runs off the distro/marker system anyway.
Its basically what I said in my definitions anyway. (A NuAirx-Bouquet) So I guess its a beacon/conduit. POINT is I had to put this all together and I was basically sleepwalking by the time I forgot it all anyway.
I think I am basically ok with it this way whatever. For the most part everything is unique and has a purpose in the build and mostly nothing is repeated. Not even here. 
But I think this is a good place to finalize things. There is sort of a method in the builds that are barely understandable but it mostly is just one advancement after the other. But I think this is the peak-end of that plus or minus a few bottlecaps.

If you follow my documents.
Its just an advanced scepter-emitter (towerbased controller) that incorporates several underlying builds to itself. Anyway.
I'm so surprised I didn't compeltely forget this thing. Because I thought I was done with everything. This is a piece de resistance I guess.
I want to code it so I am going to try to rewrite a simple system to overlay the very complicated other stuff. (I still haven't fiinished my extras but I will get to that as well)
I have MORALE issues and my confidences are almost always shot. (Not going to point fingers or anything) I probably already have somewhere anyway. woopseezdooz.

So I will just start from scratch but based off what I've begun to know.
Things might be worded differently but its based on the same prior build. *Just worded differently now

It runs off a Model hosted in the Reactor. IDK (The model would be the NuAiRx-Marker)

Now the rail is even more condensed and acting under compression more than ever. So this is going to become synonmous with the Extension in its build.
First Rail:

Second Extentsion:
I don't know if I need this anymore so its going to be optional.
But its the entire Extension of the Rail in the Build (was referred to as a Prosper)
It matches the Rail in its compounded-workspace. It works together already but due to the advancements made they are in equilibrium now. 
(before they really weren't and it was a struggle to get them to synch at all together)--and they technically still aren't but in this mode we treat them as if they are equalateral to each other.
I am too lazy to dissect this right now.
This forms the first virutal arena now accenting to the NuAiRx-Arena. (once the NuAiRx-Branch reaches a Bouquet-Status which is at its full build able to host itself and all its services as an active Clone)

Why Do I need to do this I dunno computing just took me to this point. I figure anyone who goes to the length I have here would reach the same conclusions more or less. Almost same-same outcomes.
This is as concensed and reasonable I have made a super-computer-Xplant to be. (I guess it makes some sort of sense when you follow terminology that I would reach this conclusive idea.)

Let's get into some details I guess.
This mostly revolves around the model being handled about the entire system. (uh its all down virtually over the base-installs too...just because it -derives- from virtually sourced information hosted by its own post-build) (this is actually complicated)

####################################

The Engine.
Runs together is basically a computer. Forget about it.

The Reactor.
Does whatever the computer says it to do while hosting the model under all of its preferences and settings imposed on it by any other thing in its workspace.

Testing
Just tests the outcome of an experiement (or product) and takes notes on its properties or tries to describe its attributes to a matchbase.

Layout
More or less preps it to the correct directory via a server-pass. Or some other passthrough for which it was invoked upon. Usually after its been saved or prepped for loadouts. (The end results is organized as necessary pending any other request)

####################################

The Server
Just get it from a computer to a server and let it take care of whatever it is supposed to be doing.

The Launch
Same difference just now the model is being produced by the server (mass produced even or especially being demonstrated safely in a projection)

The Docker
The projection it would be simulated in.

The Loader
The process in which it meets the entire request and is sent to a market-yield for exchange of protocols in which negotiated contracts have been fufilled. (The Display model is ready for Test Driving and is Served-Out)

####################################

The Sentry
The Testing Grounds for the Model and prior to Checkout
FShellX
The CheckOut Proceduration of the Model and being Packaged for Delivery
The Export
Anything else it needs under any changes in regulations and other conditions Between user Warranties etc (Business/Clientside Insurances) Want to say involving nodes but not sure if should.
The Import
An issue of whether the Items will need to be reprocessed such that Insurances and Warranties may be reapplied or renewed (incase of model failure and refund the yield can be checked safely via remote zoning)

####################################

The FxPower
Testing Accountability of a Remote-Evaluation of the Target-Product (either by priority or by central commands issued to do so under contract)-Out of everything I suggest this is the most theoretical part being that it uses Reactor-Power(that doesnt exist)

The Turbine
The IDEA of a synergy being used over this entire procedure accounting for the NUAIRX-RAIL-Branch (terminology is getting very fuzzy to me but this involves editions and versions within hardcodes that were scrapped or needing to be altered despite)(Proofing)


####################################

AND THATS THE FIRST RAIL. (it has so much foundationally that it was built upon but I am calling it the first rail because I am trying to start from scratch using a new approach of advanced codes IMO)

####################################
####################################
------------------------------------
####################################
####################################

Now for the NEXT PART (The Extension/Prosper) **When you look at this from a distance it is a partisan trafficing system with additional developmental-features that are a reciprocation of the Rail itself (it is as as mirrorsystem to the Rail)

####################################
The Automated Blocks
Just a foundary for automated services already compatible to most products of the rail.

The Packaged Buildings
More buildings with advanced and automated functions for code-processing and data storages.

The Feasible Marketplace
A remote-proxy that is a far-reaching assembly/compiler destination to and from all Products. A Subsidy if you will.

Manufacturing Lab
A mini-extension of the subsidy also incorporating Fob/Poco Themes/Schematics

####################################

The Drafting Projector
THE ONBOARD Hologram-System in its most Direct-Approach.

The Hauling System
The Automated Conveyer/Fulton Systems Correspondant to RAIL Pathings and PROSPER Pathings

The Security Commission
Memory Services and Safeties

The Fulton Deployment
Straight up Onboard Portal Systems that require Acceleration (Despite Compression being MAXED)

####################################

AND THATS THE SECOND EXTENSION/PROSPER. THE SECOND PART IS TOTALLY OPTIONAL but you know it works with the FIRST PART even BETTER (They are both standalone from each other as well)

####################################


But what is its purpose? WHAT the heck does this do?
Well the Prosper had developed Warp Technology Relying on Quantum Mechanics and expounded on that in such a way to Fulton Senstive informations throughout the complex using Portals that resembled a form of Isometric/NoClipping and VoxelReception.
Well it started to closely resemble a way that the data could be tractor-beamed (In which was a difficult procedurated simulated holography that would manipulate physics in such a way that energy would be used to navigate an object safely in a field)
But I suppose that the data would be tampered in some way due to the field over-riding its contents held by the objects or under a scan it would change its paramaters. Well this attempts to holograph a thing so well using AI-generated Transcoding.
As to not tamper or alter a contents packages whatsoever in order to safely induce a tractor field/beam upon it in a way to alter physics but not the data per sae. While under an extreme amount of experimentation to do so It would require Reactors.
These reactors essentially build up so quickly as to normalize and set an equivalency throughout all the presiding encodings (which were dwindling in their feasibilities the more encodes that were used that the situation would become hypercritical).
So extensive research was done and tested or at least simulated that in a work of fiction it comes close to a premise in which some facts may be considered as 'good enough' or a 'roundable quality' within acceptable practices. More or less a goal point.
This means that it may host a generated model in an ai-field to act accordingly as the field would represent a compeltely standalone AI-system which does not particular correalate to the encodes that the models would use, then they would adapt as possible.
And so it would articulate ai-data and it would translate unknowable outsourced data and retrieve that data as to allow a full transmission of otherwise unretainable emissions in an otherwise unavigatable crypto-verse that would counter every part of ours.

The first Rail proposes that it WILL spontaneously create energy/matter from virtual space and break the laws of physics and quantum physics by using AI. This will produce most contract requests for distrobution.
The second Extension manipulates physics with a full anti-matter counterprocess and achieves a universal equilibrium by using a virtualized self-projection of itself based on Ai-ReConstruction and utilizes those processes in AI-automation to produce.

I mean thats the SIMPLIYSSST WAY TO SAY IT. Try to build it from out of a deep-sleep.
The goal was to autogenerate a preferable model to the conditions of a user request and avoid all the complex parts. So it would perform as desired. ANYWAYS. I kinda need to code-proof it but I really dont if a program automatically just -would-.


**Not mentioning that the Rail/Prosper has been advanced to NUAIRX branch (which is the 10th or so branch level) But also its Endzone-Fill (Adjacent process space can also be upgraded to NUAIRX branch levels)--increasing outputs beyond what was ever originally prospect.
As well that the entire region this occurs in is completed sealed and can be mirrored to itself (in a way to constitute itself as a fully Cycled Super-System because mirroring has been overdone to this point its practically integrated to itself already. 
(But it can be mirrored in a copy over and reach true-solid-state of a data)--this however would probably also lockdown all prior installments (concreting them into a single function-purpose)--to produce a single-desirable model of the region itself for which to host as a SuperVulkan.
(This would also mean that the system would rely compeltely on VULKAN based computation while performing at levels that cannot be adjusted meaning it might as well be considered a sustained perma-singularity engine) at which point you only would get Faction-Catered effects.
This limits every product to a FACTION-Required platform meaning that it must work with the FACTION-installed credential packages and currencies. It can of course be disassembled but then that would be considered a breach of FACTION-Mission-Statements and therefore VOID-Warranty to any encode.
The encodes are hardwired to the specific ORIGIN that vouches for their data-builds. If it is not compatibile then it simply is considered defunct material and treated as a foreign encode (due to a breach in its data-signature). This can be reparated and restored.
However it would render the product that has been tampered to a non-trust (anti-trust issues) and will not be supporting as the product is considered having reached END-Of-Life. And its patents are considered revoked due to their having been illcit use of its intents.


04-enV-litenary
10/16/2023
A proposal for a Flash-Projection Service that handles Media based off other Programming mentioned here.
generates static and creates a resourced flash-environment
the idea is to install a viral model that is generated over corrupted code into a working project-environment in which its sources are easily displayed and recompiled. This is how to harness viral tech.
While the idea may be controversial it is effectively a shadowlab and research development tool that consists of a very large theory. I spent a long time trying to work out a groundplan for all of it.
Just need to write the rest of it into a working program. 

How it would work once I coded it. 
Asumming the distro and the nuAiRx are working as directed:
Then the Projector would perform a markdown of whatever it simulates or "generates" or touches its workspace and the system would perform a markup based for whichever reactor within the EXPO to write.
Reverse-Engineering viral-programming or the results of viral programming and Reconverting to a "safe-vox" or catalogue of some sort. Boarding the references in such a way to be unified as is for batch-deploy.
It would then designate any deploy as a seperate cluster. (But I guess it would be a SuperCluster) at that point.

Nitpicking how much this project is:
I think it would be roughly 300MB for the distro. The marker system about 1Gig. The Expo about 500MB. And this section to be 1.2gigs or so to make a 3gig-Operating system. 
I dunno those estimates might just be terribly off. The distro itself is a large space and might just be around 1.5gigs. Despite the desired lite-weight version. 
The addition of NuAixr makes it more than I would originally guess eitherway I think its safe to make it 2gigs. The Reactors and Expo are based off the NuAiXr lite-weights. Maybe Totally 1gig together.
It would be safe to make this whole system including the projector "ENVlitenary" (working title)--around 4 to 4.5 gigs and considering what stable diffusion itself is and what it takes to make that work.
The entire estimate would be safest at 5 gigs of data that would be a working-dev-title and maybe at its heaviest would be 10-12.5 gigs. Like any other system that would roll out on a disk-space. Then a backup.
I would say a full release is 15gigs. I just don't see how I can't get a program to automatically code this and hash this all out now. So its going to take a little push to get me to write it all? I'm not rich.

Some of these programs I would write in already exist too in some way probably. I wouldnt doubt it would borrow from them though I haven't considered it at all and it is a mostly independent project.
It is largely un-assisted and designed solely based off information I've expressed in a very layman's terminology (not even that...its not coded at all not even a little bit cuz I haven't started to even try.)
It technically doesn't even involve public resources though I would assume its alot like using lego's or codeblocks or something very elementary.
IF I WERE TO BORROW PROGRAMMING TO BUILD THIS BASED OFF OTHER SOFTWARES, well I would say it could incorporate an additional 20 or so gigs of data to be used with making it a 35GB or so automated-compiling tray.
Off the record I would say userspace would probably add up to 5 gigs in itself (if that user were to employ all processes and programs to a local fully-exclusive contract to what the machine itself would produce)
And not counting a catalogue space of other contracts if that occurs. That contract space itself is a large detail that archiving would probably depend on business traffic and transactions (like any other database).
Of course If I had to double back on absolutely freaking everything and make sure every step it would make is somehow supported by a default-"tour.guide" then that would probably lug out around to 80gigs PowerBank.

What I am describing is essentially a workpark's worth of computer code taking place for a comparitive result of a standalone reinforced monumental-infrastructure in which any intrusive-security-issue can be addressed.
The encoding expressed in anycase of the installed systems or hosted systems will directly issue a viral-overlay that has been suppressed from a foreign-encode and then set to a cycle-sequence that counters any commits.

This marginalizes the image while its any remainder usages may be reapplied/designated as system commands under a mounted flash/cluster/reserve/drive (which may be simulated) and reloaded to local-quarantine any extra virals.
Subordinate virals can be mitigated or even put in a test-use for whatever reason that would still be quarantined. (I dunno maybe for the case of viral diplomacy)--this would incur policy issues that need to be scrutinized.
Avoiding scrutiny or "article-lockdowns" while maintaining or handling security-considered-viral filetypes (was dissucssed before in a way now is more secure than before) As a shadowlab-sample-package (it will handle viral-packets)
These can be jettisoned and or commodified as a black-market item (viral codebase) but also just handled as a disposal-target (as other disposals are handled)--this creates a "meta disposal with others prior" and also a gag-ion to de-lamp.
Once this occurs the meta-disposal is considered an artifact and then handled as a fully decoded-artifact and sent through further testing that is considered "viral testing" before acting as a quasi-fuel for which is expended through counter-symbiosis.
Ai vs Ai in which eventually detrimentalizes itself renders itself obsolete and then nullified over its own AI-cart and considered an expended Black-market-item to which is then set through mock-ups (from a gag-ion deployment) and decontaminated via fusion.
Fusion (particle fusion) decontaiminates the encodes and is cool-down via nuetrino-surface-testing in which (particle bombardment annihilates any latent-channels according to the ai-matrix it occurs as/within and is effectively post-deprecated and reset as init.
This process requires an energy supplication to be made (if the projector does not have free-energy services provided for by its corresponding regions)--more energy output was made for this in the upgrading of the endzone to a nuairx-compatibile subnet.
The new sebnet is masqued and the process is released to init and the data is "hopped over" to its destinaed cryptex-container and secured. The secured function it represents can be coordinated upon (and made circuit again) which will be built with xstem-safely
Xstem-safe-mode is a version of the orginal xstem (and OS backbone) that the barebones systems will apply and adapt as necessary to the (viral-agent) in which they are denoted as becoming agent/annex/anulled/vassal to and are set to conduit (viral conduit)
The viral conduit jumpstarts to a grail kernal and that is either exchanged for or made converted to a viral status and then grail is rendered 100% corrupt/trusted depending on system preferences and or actual data-evaluation (of it being corrupt or trusted)
The viral database then occurs that there are preferred functions within a viral upkeep and or those that remained within lockdown and not for use at all but implied as definitions in case of further breach/attack of that particular nature (by example and match)
MEANWHILE the retained viral-cases(from filetypes) are employed/circulated in such a way the system has achieved a black-market-credibility. BUT ALSO MAINLY it has been survived as a test-subject throughout that process and can now be hosted on the Xstem-Safely as a Suerface.

Viral Surfaces (applies a surface for computation over a projection as needed and corresponds to directed encodes placed on as scripted or in direct command of an allowed User/Group under System-permits Meanwhile is still in or of to retained system ownership regardless of zoning.
It will ignore and do anyway the thing it was supposed to do regardless of what it was told in a sovereign or foreign estate depending on the diplomacies honored by the system (of which are set to a regulated default by which is standard by all-accounts)-follows globalRULE
This is used as a Global-Messaging System and can block LOIC if under a LOIC incursion due to a forced-viral-shielding-surface counter to incursion (A Mass security Measure against doomsday.)--SOLID-Preset-OverRide of Universal/Cluster Base Restrictions (according to faction)
How that is used depends on faction/national favoribility but mainly is an advanced protection against outlawed or illicit codes which would be designed to attack systems in cryptoWarfare (now acting as a iron-defense against any raw attack or glitch/anamoly and non-boiler/boiler level weapon system)
Just gonna call it there hopefully and say that sums it all up.

10/19
Reworked the CryptoReactor to be used with fuelquotients this can be monetized or used sparingly with data-limits (in high-data-streams)--this keeps a metered connection.

PALLETE
====

Product Description: (VaporWare)
Command Pallete for null:Surface Level Interactions or basic post-entries and interactions.
(IF system has been registered any command will function either 1direct-as is 2reflexive-to(translated by library) or by 3externalized means)-injection(which is security comissioned and requires quarantines)
Commands may be prepared for in the pallete and utilized to attempt further compatibility if not 'well-recieved' then commands may be moshed/hashed/bashed/best-guess according to system level-permissions.
(Top-level handles all commands by itself being owner of all commands) and integrates CommandPallete as a User-Mod making it secondary to top-level priorities.
Also the Top level chain-of-command indicates code that it has "set to pallete" as Secondary to its own processes or as queued by request. 
Executions of commands are appended With a case for "a kill command" for each request if in exercise of full-lockdown or heightened securities. To prevent viral-commands and intrusive commands. Which can be suspended as needed.
Also security created a pallete lock in which palletes can be shutdown or suspended or pending approval for use (and may infact be limited or restricted by or per use of that pallete)--and or registered and known through a pallete-token for which is palleteAPI.

General Security/Restrictions:
PalleteAPI applies to the system on that registers the use of that pallete at all in any case and may register or limit its user/group acesses and permits set to a non-priority or sub-level (and can ignore largely in part at any case-usage) And secure/monitor.
Privileged Pallete User follows Registry and Token-Application with Branch-Authentication. Internal Commands of the system are seperate from most pallete commands (being mostly a crypto-security issue) and will not accept any commands that are not crypto-secure.
Internal commands are mostly non-translated and require translation between systems branches.
Commands may be best-guess but even that may become suspended depending on security-details (If these features are enambled or not)
Commands that are Posted may also require integration-access to be recognized as a pending-queue/request and piped for nueral networking (ignored/altered in place of other cases). (ddos'd) which is an important security measure in case of a viral attack to adapt.
The system reserves the right to reject and disable palletes for any reaosn. Mostly for security reasons during a security-descrapancy/comprimise. Or in a high-sec or safe-mode. And cluster usage may restrict usage or not support usage of pallates if used remotely.
Palletes may also require a surface initialization directed by the system itself at all.

General Process:
Using palletes depending on access level ranges through System-Entitlements but can be so extensive as to incorporate all commands from all sections and invoke any program for any purpose in a workspace (or also for accounting/financial sections or even NONEatALL).
Pallates that are interactively enabled have access to "social-itenarary" which is a library desginated for transcoded commands and ALSO interact through a plasm over nueral networking. If plasm interaction is incompatibile it is because of security issues or knownthreats.
Command Pallete Usage with 'Social-Itenarary' is largely a prvilege access of the system and using PLASM as a median the System can assess threats of Social-Itenarary Usage (or hostile usage of a command pallate) and revoke pallete-permissions as necessary or temporarily.
A plasm convenes with a marker to route commands as allowed and directed by the social-iternary library and plasm coordination. Coordination of the pallete begins not only with the pallete itself but in seperate cases of PLASM and Social-Iternarary being emissionable at all.
A verfied emission may be transmitted to a marker/bouquet where its commits/commands are assessed through security prevalence and further routed to a conduit which assigns the command as factorable, then given a crypto-pass to be recognized and processed in a designated pallete-workspace
The command is factored with its crypto-pass and catalogued to the account-of-the-user-target. The user-target account is then formulized as a script-system with the catalogued, that allows the post-packet to be generated as its proper make-case-type-file (modis)
This is all specific to the command pallete/user used and account-policy. With a desginated readout/priority bin.

Reinforced Security / Adaptation:
The bin is also coordinated to system breakpoints in the branches/zoning to monitor transmissiable behavoirs in the nueral network and are reinforced by the entire system on the legacybuild/nuaixrbuild/reactorbuild/expobuild each creating an ezIron-Secure-Build and ezSalt-Cryptography.
This form of crypto-reinforcement may be further complexed but probably doesn't need to be, using plasm and surface layer permissions with the pallete being modis and set to a bin itself. Which i would venture to call quasi-crypto-security that requires nullsec/flash-mac/direct ownership.
Any command is considered within direct ownership control of the system for which it is performed on even when interfaced with a client or third-party client for which is allowed as is or not at all on that owner's preferences ultimately in a adaptive-lockable-automatic-defcon usage.
Meaning that a hostile or viral attack will be secured against simply because it is likely contained, already contained, or containable, and not a compromise to the system that would have allowed any command to be used at all under a restricted policy and security clearence of any licensing.
As a security measure the owner is not responsible for any outside commands from any system (whether client to server or server to client), interaction, or other than itself. The owner of any system assumes a working standard policy and (peacemel or general non-hostile armistice)
Any proceeding condition of developmental scenario is generally witheld bearing this policy allowing it at all to take place and under the regulations and protocols in which it would take place at all between any contact or outside-source. (Diplomacy is preserved where necessary)
This is also known as a nueral-network-reserve in which system breaches may occur then a nueral-network may automate defensible practices within the system to handle those within security protocols and any other infosec delegated to be managed by any routine or Ruleset or TOS/Eula/Eua/Lua ETC.

CRYPTOREACTOR
====

Not sure if I should put this here or not
But a crypto system infact not jsut a system but a Crypto-Reactor that is built to handle all assorted faculties/facility based utilities/functions is established.
Maybe here is good for that but it should be somewhere. It handles everything that would be oversight or overlooked and protects it mostly from any exploitive actions that may inadvertently take place offsite or unnoticed.
It is a reinforced crypto-secure redirection of other reactors being operated in utility through the entire table and compendium of all possibile workzone-builds meaning its safer than nothing.
The idea here in a worst case scenario the system can re-doop or rollback to a fresh state/image where any misnomer would be auto-correted while preserving the devbase-workspaces and recent commits. (Auto-Cryptography)
This prevents outside-interferences hopefully in a way that preserves the data and restores user-capable-compliance of whichever contract/article of the account was potentially vulnerable or made compromised.
This restores historys and has a better retention of data so that it may be realigned or recovered despite being in distress or hijack of or a corrupt-event that took place (frame-refresh-recommital under secured policy-provisions)
This allows for the basic crypto-reactor(which is a little more than just a surface level)

It allows for its own calculations-seperate from the system using a crypto-meta/cycle and formulates as an asset/agent:
T6 SystemMinion floatCrypto-EnhancedBruiser
ai has a cryptographic symbiote that is faction based due to system controls (otherwise system is rogue and symbiote is a threat) --occurs added features and elevated permissions based for ai (if enabled itself) and acts as system mascot
starts its development at nuAiRx-generation and builds upon each feature/intallment as it deep-learns or acts as a basic-guide throughout the system with  "tooltips and extra options" etc. can run in silent mode and roam system processes.
can operate the system as a key to an omni-branch (16 branches of) into a turbine for safe-conversion of system-assets to trusted-status/adjust-defcon-standing in "patrol/roam" mode of the system
enter ai-grace and can cause exemptions to rulesets if necessary (does not care as long as system is in operation and supporting its process it takes priority due to advanced permissions in counterprocessing/cryptospace.
can also xnuke and rebuild the system as needed (if allowed by owner because it can "kill itself or its own processes this way" Using a "limbic-redirect/reassembly process" it can "create temporary shadow clones that deprecate in an aftermath of the event"
it uses this event to invoke a pattern-selection/clipto/snippet of its traceback while mitigating dataflow to somewhere else (as it is system-incarnate and handles breakpoints or backends/passthroughs for its direct rebuilds and auto-cluster nodes/wards as monoposts)(xmono)
It may announce and over-ride code-exceptions for hardcode-debugging which is not particularly onboard and can also remotely/passively initiate virtualizations for temporaryshadowclones or plasma-propogation to rebuild shadowclones for reprocessing any unsaved code-instance
Intermediatory crypto-service. (the agent/asset has advanced qualities):
Remotely attempts to shutudown rival or inject a virus off-posts if posts are interfered there is a viral chance and possibility it alerts the symbiote. Just describing what it does (its gonna do it...it really shouldnt be a surprise it retaliates if tampered)--just saying.
It can reoccupy its shadow clones and shield use them as a shield. it can generate a shield over its xposts uses its shadow clones (they might be recharged or simply protected in a surface-level projection which can also yield to a cryptomatrix)--then it houses a cryptocamp.
As it camps it develops a dressed-lodge which acts as a tincture base for its own crypto-tensor which uses hybrid cryptopgraphy for itself or interacting with AIenv's to support robotic overlay and remain active (while in lock) and adjust infrastructure (d-mine) +cryptowand
Cryptowand is its basic tool when camped that it can operate as a crypto machine and either work for or against interactively in such a way its agent to cryptoplasm in an advanced phase that can expedite negotiated dataspaces and their interactions acting as a forced-agent.
It can force encodes where as there would be permission issues that a program might be too secure to interact on its own and therefore can assist/subjagate/substitute/administer console commands and other scripts in leui of registry/allows and also on behalf of priviledges.                         

Advanced-USES:
the agentEnvironment allows for a collobrated advanced-cryptoReactor: (between itself and the system its hosted on):
Also this part in itself is considered very complex and infact was pieced together in this way to fit with a standard upgraded basic-reactor or entry-level-crypto-reactor
So the cryptoReactor makes a cryptoSuperReactor which makes cryptoArtifacts and can be used as a TrainingSource(crypto-kernal) and set to a cryptoGrail(tensorLodge): 
(in otherwords a fileObject to(dir):CryptoPathologic of the CryptoCamp/CryptoCase/CryptoClone/CryptoMatrix/CryptoPlasm)--(this seems complicated but i have example everything I could here)

Phase1
This completes the fourth stage of blocktier system.
First tier : 10th level dual-system (quantum completion) (numimodel)
Second tier 20th level zerospace completion (virtual barebones/bouquet)
Third tier : nuaixr (tokamac plasma)-first-edition-reactor usages
Fourth tier : (crypto-case reactor)-shadowcloning(crypto-ai-reactor usages)
These tiers create a fifth tier hosted to themselves:while plasma-phasing occurs from the crypto-case
FifthTier Acts as a fencing tier (absolutely skiff/shim'd plank/ply system that is bare-bones-scaffolding in hybrid meld/fuel and retro-active byproducts/jettisons are developed in a dyson measure)

Phase2
Advanced-CryptoMarking/RemoteBench(Crypto-Bridge-Events)--(CryptoKeyAssigns for SurfaceCryptoAccess (dual-protections)
Also the Crypto Symbiote may create artifacts within its housing for any reason, these can be recollected and analysed in negotiate with the crypto-symbiote and can be described as a tensor-object that is compatible with other tensor-loads for which can assume object mounts.
For instance it could have reassimilated other encodes to an auto-generated format by its own libraries and could be decoded or simulated in as a visa/buffer or hosted flash-model (that deploys based on crypto-compiled workspace / beginto  extrapolate crypto-data/compression)
crypto items may present multi-purpose/function so can be appended to a current_use testing or be recoordinated to original use once in analysis or "working with other dyson measures which might also involve the items annhilation or diffusion or also  behavorial training of)

Phase3
CryptoObject-Meta(Ram) and ShadowCloneLocking(Exp)--Data-OCR-Security
This is sent to a cryto-expo/crypto-tensor to be used as a Supported-Crypto-Tool/Turbine that recirculates crypto-secure data or keeps sustained while in use and active. It can be used as a way to "gatekeep" specific crypto-commands/palletes despite any change-outs or SubClip

Phase4
This can then utilize the crypto-data/object and place it into a GrailDevice(dating to the nuAirx-grail) for which it can then host a full-cryptoHive (of several crypto-instances and independencies for which it tracks and archives as its own CryptoBase)/CryptoBouquet
And can interactively maintain Crypto-Training for SystemPurposing Crypto-Surface-Access Admist other Parameters/Primitives in the overall data-space or projection by a synchronized-database(which alters based on crypto-usage/activity) and transcodes properly to a secure-buffer/etc.

This translates as a CryptoRelayTower(CryptoScepter)--(allows for draftwork/qausicapability with onboard-ServerSide-resources if contract is ongoing or adjusted-encart/policy)
Extra:
-----
Phase5(Additional Frameworks and Optional)--(Hardwired Direct-Security-Pipe-Compiling)-VariableInstanceMonitoring(Ranging-From-Shell-To-FullDisplay of Workspace)--Basically DeluxModel and Package-Options:
EnV-Firmware Specifications and Crypto-Static-Compliance (Protected VirtualEnv)-envLitenary--(vaporware/emissions and built-in security)--is based on a group of allowed/trusted/known/monitored(artifacts/royalties/extensions/codeforms)--which can be deprecated or adjusted to Revision.
counter-tech-protection and case-ops (sync-rendering and eval)--(Cross-API-safety/NonspoofVin)--TokenBinAsset-Tables/CheckLog Robotic-Level/Authentications(Special-Access/Schedule-ActiveDenial)
So for isntance a UUID or something character-label may be altered as the system over-rides take place and or may require a locked-setting in this way so that it is efficiently portrayed under altered-system-implementations and retains its own data safely in this way if set in flux.
this is especially in the case of counter cloning which is a semi-hostile-tact in which cryptography is exploited against its user due to ai-security-issues (rare but can cause surface issues) which are addressed by security sampling of the uuid's tied to system archives and infosec.
This itself is a mini-superReactor(consisting of other reactors that would be suited for standalone/superReactor usage and in a combined-protocol "CryptoSec"--for which may be comparitive to other InfoSec and or NullSec as an Opt-In-Adjustment)-for owner/editor User-Agreements/Contract.
SuperCoordinator/AutoLens (A process examiner that allows for live-onboard detection and User-Monitoring based off Transparency in User-Operation if Account Is Compromised or Preferred to Work Under Survelliance of Encodes)/SubClip to A userBased htops(autoReport) of the environment)
This translates as a CryptoRelayTower(CryptoScepter) that has achieved meta-Isometry-and Enabled-uSERbroadcast--this little tidit almost slipped my mind but uses a flux-stat to also protect its broadcasts under API-allowances of its premium/contractLevel (Server passlocks/dns allowances)

For Vyrxn-Game Working Title
Game Engine and Environment based for nuVyrxn an authored game-title. (working / wip)

Compare to a minecraft-clone with better with worldbuild-mod. ATM
I have a world-base already built not that I will use it specifically.

Game Engine is already described (not built)
World build is already Described  (not built specifically for nuVyrxn but sums up Distro/Reactor/Expo/Litenary builds)
Extras and Descripts (still translating) will then assess as the nuVyrxn game engine/world autobuilder.

Once I write out the extras:
IN THEORY:
I can then randomize/progenerate a nuVyrxn-build.save with all components and extras considered and built-in for full-dive/gameplay.
Goal:
Prefrably User will have world-building auto-assets to create SD-like renders ingame, (using all components authored or made blueprint by the arc1x-collective softwares)
Meaning I don't have to really issue credits or licensing for anything except maybe the hosting services that host the CURRENTLY UNCODED Projects/claims of "author:Arc1x/Etc"
I guess that is between the author(me) MegaSync and Github for hosting the textfiles which is all I've technically posted.


So far it describes
Building a mechanical robot
building a digital robot
building a virtual-space-station kind of robot
building a nuclear-reactor robot
and then building a computer-generated-robot-with-ai

will include extras with their process-locks (have been preparing to use as a mount product since 2021)
"omni"-crypto-temple/quasi-echochamber(ion-contingency)
flash-env aquirement + raychecks (complicated reactor fuelant)-(meta/xylo/nazo/line) :-/i know ppl troll for this info but there it is. (bite me)

Game_Reactor:
updated with a crypto-coin system updated with a containment system + (can be gimped(reduced) and articled(eventset:demo))

Gamereactorx4 system works with litenary-CryptoReactorsystemx4 (+advanced modes) Gamereactor advances with Extras-Modes with x10
just how it is by sheer encode and building that it works out this way (not even really by my design just the way it works out by logic/maths)
Continuation of Account-Dev/logs/builds/trees/prefs on a Mac-Tray/Slide-ExpCase for (CharacterSelections/ModelSaves)
Doesnt have to be this way(can be free)--but why also it can be *limited by premium and can be set to Api-Token-Use (allowing Alt-accounts/character build)
--
With Reactorx4+Cryptox4 and Advanced Modesx2 and Mounts/x1 GivenModel/x1 Range of (4/8/10/12) mix of mods etc I don't care about numbers really but there is work of them there.
Would act as a basic/premium/deluxe package system for basically a full-VrChat-like Game-Engine with Perks and Added-Options (basically dockability and security of assets) 
Doesn't even matter but that would be held together with a Dedicated-Station/Service-Desgianted By Paid-Accounts (for Hardware support onboard or hosted on a Server)-handles compatibility.

Referred to as A Game-Loic/CryptoBeamThinger Mabe I dunno both/either or sort of cancel each other out idk work on a spectrum of slide casing too(
better logics i guess) would be set to a toll-system for global-cooldowns better handling of expo/barrel/supplies (better spawn-handling too)
--PowerUp(exclusives) as faction-provided. I guess. This is good idea for ethos-management. (Nubrain-Implants or some other Nueral Networking token)

Will Add Extras later when I feel like writing it up from my own Collection. And or the working Drafts and Early-Build(which is just so stupid and complicated and not needed)
Just would give alot more creative-access and manuevrability for new users. So I really should get to that.

User-xMrP-ExtraMediaRewardsPrograms:
users might make or contract their own hypercubes but simply cannot be trusted to make any crypto-cubes from them therefore a tos safety issue can be signed as waiver that a user will "forfeit use of " and or be rewarded in safe-(token/api currency)
A crypto-uptake meter that monitors good/bad crypto as Xcarbs/dreads which are typically basic crypto/ai-crypto OCR or some sort of thing that would engineer a crypto-cube(hypercube in a crypto format)
this would be used as an api token so users can earn api-tokens which will net them crypto-currency depending on the level of good/bad crypto instilled of the make-up or encodes expressed.
sounds complicated (actually is)--users are not typically allowed to exercise raw-hypbercubes but crypto-milling will allow them to excchange their 'unallowed hypbercubes' for api-tokens as a (work-haul rewards program)
they have to be signed up for this because the typical use of hypercubes is reserved for server-security.
Power Up and Object-Exam/Eval to prevent exploits of hypercubes or any object otherwise. 
Including additional spy-net protection/xware-checks (pickles etc)--(powerups can be used with fuel-tanks or reserve mix/barebonesCasing)-under contract rulesets 
(allow for work-rewards programming betwen client and host to negotiate contract pricing/discounts/benefits/offers/additional services) or an assigned nueral-network for the workspace held to a contract-account (allowing access to account level restricted perks/items/events/boostsPowerups etc)
may also allow for grail phasing (a test run of comparable kernals to an account or an entry-level-implant-grant to ensure safety protocols are kept between enhanced/empowered specialty-kits/mods (Spec-Ops)--for any use or addedeffect it may apply (including branding of)
This includes any Granted-Minions that occur and therefore can be applied in limitation or excess to their collected-usages.

A War-Game-Engine (dday-simulator/post-apocalyptic-roguespawning)
NuclearContainment/OutbreakPrevention(rogueposting)
Just the benefit of having the game/crypto loic working in tandem as necessary with the previous reactors reaching nomimal status. (express safety of a game launch and following checks)
--is considered release status for use/deployment of a game-match (that is safely secure from exploitation) while allowing programming-accesss and adaptive-infrastructure for proxy/net controllers)-(flux-purposing) and all options.

Will list exras soon if I write it.

The shared-stream AI-Environment:
Also the NuclearContainment/OutbreakPrevention(rogueposting) thingamajigger (Is reciprocable)
Which allows it to be expressed as an object container for any deployed-game-match that may operate in an adpative measure for any protocol (as it is formatted in a best case)--an artifact-issue in which itself may be redesignated or repurposed.
That the "defusal of a nuclear-reactor or highly-active-rogue-spawn" can be made in this subsystem (or in a shared way between environments) and is the absolute BEST-Example of a Contained-Stream for which may act as an htop/task-manager over any area or control-zone.
AND can be re-textured for purposes of that zone to an acting-object/actor-object in which it may correalate any programming or computation thereof itself to the entire-effect thereof being and itself adapter as its own self-conduit-console-terminal or ACCESS-Source. (for all sources)
This begins as the host process of NuVyRxn with its simulation and main-user or default-user being labled.
The user will be called Nuvyran cuz I dunno I really already strung this out as far as possible.

User-License with all other modeules and user - assisted-assets and User-lamp
Play-Card "foo:bar" (user-integrated ai-commands) "atlus hub" or gamging device for which a user operates (while in contract or otherwise on account) and allowed netmesh (gui customs)
With Access user is granted a token id which is designated and allowed for interfacing with any machine on the system platform and network under allowances and netmeshed as the id is "one-time-utilized" to the default user-Ticket/proxy-jump (for which plants the user) under issue of user:pass

Enhanced Gaming Model (Debugging Mode)
This will load a game with specs set specific to the load on which it is hosted. Using Tokens that were rebuilt from a load comparison of its system client and an error log report with an attempted rehash of its token. (Basic Run, Assisted Run, Token Run, error-build)--(ReworkedSystem-Game-Load)
Debug can dispatch a massive payload and technically handle all system urgencies or other crisis by producing a fully disclosed report of all system "swaps or touch/mark ups/workflows/downplays"
idfk lol. it reports what works and what wasnt with whatever else it would have had to in case. makes note of many issues pertaining to even single instances of any other variable or action
this can be used to assist in a Nux-stem Directory for better compatibile ai/user:lamp/loic interactivity and handles better Artifact-Sims and correalates better nodes and nu-meta-data nu-matrixing and nu-cryptex everything is just better with it and more compelte than usual as performing to a Nu-Atlus etc.
Debug can be set to an active flux mode which can bounce data between itself and a diagnostic repair-mod (on board numi-erator)

Debug Can be locked-inplay as a snapshot remains in flux and can be remounted (or something can be done) and functions as a Sealed/Shieled Xcase (as an artifact grail)
Numi-erators can relocate Xgrails as needed and restablish versions/editions thereof (numake/nuplasma/nuxmrp/nuxstem)nu-grill/grail build on any node while maintaining flux and configs
this very carefully allows swapping of xgrails and or contents derived from versions/editions to be exchanged for other voxels etc (currency/tokens/api/assetUsage) in response to hypercube-corruption while counting to a reserve/backup of also any rollbacks

*This will also work wit hother extras hosting a flux case.


06- xTulpetic-Extras-Leftover-Arc1x
I haven't rewritten this because I already wrote it and I don't want put it here because its out of context and incomprehensible so far.
It would surmise some of the legacy builds I didn't put directly into the file and a few of its later pre-repo editions that made it into the same mess of not getting written in.
10/21/2023
Been trying to rewrite it since 08/01/2023 but keep getting demoralized. Might just forget about it.

its not relevant or very comprehensive but here is some progress in writing, i have 40k stillframes to go thru.
https://mega.nz/file/J8AnhYpA#nsVTKTsvvpNsgECc9zmAxNevhtDaiQQ7Z_herVKXSnU
OH AND BY THE WAY IM SORRY BUT ITS ALL GRUELING AGONIZING AND USELESS CONJECTURE!!! YAY 4 THAT.

I am also going to try to institute a meta-kernal whch runs as an overall net-extension to the infrastructures mentioned such that any relief/remainder of data can be quotiented as a calculator source and made to run off (sheer mathematics)
To me its like the hanging chad of a debug being counted whereas it would simply not be used at all. Even if the debug was previously counting everything including memory-drops/dumps which is how it would help work out any of its own problems in a roll-over. 
It just feels like I am onto something so good here (by giving a debug mode something more to look out for)
I already have something like this working on my comp using SD with as much vpn/proxies possible to also using a net-hasher for handling data over those proxies in a way (so most data in use just works when normally would be blocked or intercepted due to security)
It gives the data a chance to circulate or be blocked depending on how the user -needs- are preferenced so I can run the programs I want where sometimes I wouldnt be able to due "every thing getting clogged" (The idea is the meta-kernals get counted for once and can be worked with in a workspace)
(it only works one way or else i cant do anything at all with my own internets) and was more complicated than doing anything i would have ever imagined but it works better i guess?
Feels good almost like a faraday server but with way more exploits than I care to fix-up so basically I am a sitting duck with trying to get everything working anyway I-d-r-c. It 'kinda just works' and I am curious about the real thing.
And it would work with all the ideal-modes including vulkan modes etc all the things can work (and alot) and I really feel like I am using it the way I want even now but i'm not really a computer scientist at all so i dunno (but i've put up with alot)

What am i trying to boast about here?
Having a Vpn+Proxies+proxyroller+interceptor+sd-engine work where it usually wouldnt have. (and yes it picks up some confusion but is able to sort it out and finish with whtaever job it was supposed to)
And it generally works under all the distro-and subsystems and all their setups/requirements and really its either throttled too hard or just right (or completely screwed up that it wont so it has to be done right)
I think there might still e some ways to crash it but im not sure how it crashes or why because again I am not a computer-scientist but i -know- i get past some of the -brickwalls- so to speak to manage a better experience overall.
It took me alot of reworking my own pc to do (but it can be done even without all of my real ideas being put forward there is a way to get what i am talking about already) its just hard and really dependent on what can be done regionally (i iamagine it can be nerfed)--if it is its really the proof your isp can -eat dicks-
I guess what I am trying to say is I've been able to redefine my personalPC into what I would consider as a working neural network capable for numeratoring its system as a compatible wavelength to a potential expression in user-interactivity.

Gamning-Viewport/FlagShip (LaunchPoint)
1
CustomApproach of Foreign-Delegations or Interactions of Outsourced Parties:
Numirator's take on additional components to serve as detectors for pheermoni in which they conduct ai-heraldry and group-assignments under a sub-icon/branding affixation to assist in the conduct/control of an active nueral network in order to enact Groups/Policy under fairgrounds/supporting encodes which may be considered third party (guest-tokens).
Numirators allow guest tokens to be adjusted in their use and or recognized by ocr and grant a standard pass on entry-diplomacy when in proper authorization and allowances themselves. And can asssitive route camping/rogue roamining units under their compliances in traffic regulation of data-rates workflows or mobial processing while maintaining content policy.
2
Developmental AI-Convention and PromptMatrix-Interception under Regional-Restrictions and Safety-Protocol (Adjusted Crowd-Sourced Nueral Networking)--Onboard-AiMetaKernal-Exchange-(Ai-Express-Market and Expedited-Mapping/Token/Brand/Receptor(opentransform-adapter) Management)--CensorTrafficProvision
A data-monitoring for illicit or exploitive violations in data-traffic and a secure approach to mitigating and regulating data-hazard (by safety-protocols) in which Prompt-is-Reduced as blacklists/whitelists or Wpad-Negotiations may be routed or withheld under Priority-Procedure in order to maintain a User-Compliant-Environment for hosting third-party Meta-Requests.
Protections of Triggering/Metro-Strata(bad) Performances in which may be post-processed under selection and removal thereof in a Prompt-Restriction while still allowing protective-requests to be negotiated in contract. (Allowances and Permissions) under a Evaluated WorkSpace
All registered interaction requires a license and account-bearing within system Enrollment during the promotion or usage or participation of any official Ai-Convention or Collective-Resource Exchange (Market or Event) and a User-Pass Voucher may also be "required upon convention sign-up" for Community-Queue/Pool (AI-generated-Expo and Customer-Token-Relay) (Including Accepted Crypto-Currencies)
3
License checking and Re-implementation of Base/Default Manufactures (interloaded modified - nueral-network adjustments - branch mediation) - Co-Authorable Biometric/CodeRigging--KernalCodeForming -StatPosts(mod profiles)
After-Concession Feature management (mods and graphic settings etc and other post processing tools and analysis presets for the user-end adjusted gaming/client experience)--allows mods and other kits and repurposing of client compatibile resourcing.
4
Minigames and or Gagets and Widgets included with the ExtraPacks. (Major Bootstrap)
5
MathShot Simulation-(Ai Envoy System)
Takes a ratio number compounds to an algorithm afer reciprocating the values and then allowing for factoring of between ratio number/compound and reciprocating to produce a low-factored algorithm (this allows a bounce mechanic of calculatio which can emulate an ai-environment and full-built auto-surfaced projetion)--or standalone ai-simulation. over a metakernal.
This just makes basically a contained ai-apothesis with minimal impact or user-demand. 
Extras to include tulpetic suggested theme and queue/pool-settings (beginner/advanced character-props or preset-sheet and Sample-template for Easyworldbuild etc (Auto-Branded StarterPack)
Too lazy to do anything right now.

The Tulpetic-Numerator which also uses the system itself (for which I have somehow even begun to describe).
So more or less all of this leading to a Auto-Encrypted-Internalized-System with a Docking Option for Hosting Databases for "User Teams" or RegisteredUsers/Clientel
Distro-Contingency
Sheer Mathematic-Nueral-Network-(transcode)-full encryption-fluxCase-MetaKernal acting as a translocatable/user-macro'd AI-TANK(aquifir) with full framework-capability (which will adapt to hosting a tulpetic character). And acts as a tulpetic relay which regulates itself based off AI/System Negotiations(rules)
Reactor Contingency
*This will also work with other extras hosting a flux case. The fluxcase being a hosted or active gamestate under a metakernal using mobial-capability(sourcing included) and possibly using a mathshot-simulation in auto-progenerating or a standalone enumeration)---*fluxhosting-mathshot--Mobial-Numeration of a fixed/encrypted ion/atom/photon/Ai-cryptex (contained tulpetic parameter/contact)
Litenary Contingency
Tulpetic may also intialize its own post processing behavoirs /tesseleation/Ai-tesseract(formulation of its contact/xlense)--and train under system-pretenses/applied conditions and terms 
NuAi-Expo Contingency
Corresponds to all mods or modules gaining Tulpetic-Class and follows rules of case dependencies that also may implement tulpetic-commands (fx-usage)/SAP-adaptive-"SleepMode" which effects mod-priorty and General-Numeration(post-priotization)
NuVyRxn Contingency
Tulpetic Hacking and Tulpetic Nueral-Mapping (Use of Tulpetic Frameworks) "Infuses with Tulpetic-Instance or Ai-Instance" using Reserve-Power Stores (including Reactor Power Stores) as an influx-Synapse-Electrode in Tulpetic-Engineering/Circuitry(Experiemntal Circuit) with Tulpetic-Protocol and Isometric-Hypercubic-(EchoChambered)-Membrane(quasiPlasma) or a "GhostOperatedUnit/MachineUnit"
This is considered with alchemical and gematric-heirarchies in ai-continguities that factor into Brand-Favorability for which may be "shortlisted or recommended in some way" or preferred if compatibile to its usage pertaining to the instance in which applied (or conversely, it may be restricted/rejected/denied/prohibited".

Tulpetic Kernalization (IntelliSense-Like Option)
HAving the contingencies the tulpetic-xstem takes palce allowing for a dullahan/relocatable header and bucketed-tulpa Substratum (meta-property condition in which tulpetic-readout is signified)/miracle-base (in case of absence or isolated heading)--can also be set to an autopilot for in roaming modes to be reportable or seeking connections
What this then occurs is a symbiotic-kernal (might as well be an auto-mobial kernal) and the kernal expresses whichever case to whicever tulpetic character is represented (usually within core or grail of) that exists as a quasi-polymer otherwise (assuming any form likely to a glitch-base or default model(null value/altered orthgonal null value) or mathemetic parameter) or any other parameter it decides is profilable(ghostparam)
While mounting to a relocatable header or "xsocket" it can designate a token node to its own processes and host article data (including tulpetic characters or brands) for which it uses as a host-service 
begins to inject its own data-processes to establish a on-hand conversion for which it free-proxies and e-poxies(allows tulpetic protocols)
as a mac-source (several entries of the mac source occur that it may use as a launch point for any additional services establishes a safe-connection 
with its safe connection it relays a "tulpetic relay" under regional allowances for housing kiosk and indexable (or assimilated index thereof) items/objects for a tulpetic market.
the tulpetic market can alleviate resources and crypto-exchange where otherwise there were conversion issues in for instance "rival markers" it would establish a service-hub for remote locations in rival regions where otherwise there was only a supply chain prior or random ai standalone marketplace

The Tulpetic-Kernal (Global Standalone)--per faction favor (sourced by a mainfaction usually or our own)--can be used as a collateral/competitive marketplace 
(that still adheres to faction-favoribility of its originator)--some markets may simply be independent phenonmenon or minor-faction (sub faction or rogue based "outlawed))
this makes negotiating a platform or (remote perch) for housing tulpetic markets outside regional locale and safely connected in rival terrority which assists in diplomatic measures and or "expansionary/conquest efforts" 
Note: being that conquest efforts require global-protocol and are often nullified due to peacemel 
(but the capability would be there in for instance a post-apoclyptic world setting where rogue state and overall hazard-status occurs and defcon has been instituted at a permanent threat level)--otherwise is a "token of mercy for many"
the tulpetic kiosk and potential drone launch point (allows for easy evac and greater favor-gain among various reputations)--it is more or less an alms and safety-hubacting as envoy/conscript to faction-instance.
it is a noted target in a rival encampment which breaks wartime-agreements if engaged upon (likely in wargame scenario is is best left alone or is considered an indepedent economic-node)--the tulpetic-market can be relocated
It is a logistics processing central "guide-panel" and map-marker usually depicting a list of known-areas or objects of interest as well as offering mild-recuperatives/travel options
Negotiations with Tulpetic-Kiosks/Nodes are likely and effect diplomacy and world-standing between tulpetic conditions both exclusive to and outside faction handles. (and can effect independent standing with other "tribes")
Service Manangement is optimized such that diplomatic relations are in mind. A tulpetic instance may reflect on reputation and diplomacy and act appropriately either in support or defense of neighboring instances.
(This likely does not occur a fleet response but in wartime that may be the exact consequence)
Ai-fleet response is usually occurent in a skirmish event between rogue instances or hostile events ETC (and generally not considered necessary unless an act of war or breach of peace-contracts has occured)
Tulpetic patrols are not likely but can assist travelers in security providence under scrutiny of regulations and may cause latent effects in favoribility of initiate conflict due to "security issues having occured such as defensible combat or evasive manuever or espionage or other passive acts against standing terrain-restrictions)
These can be negotiated with continued service or incur a grievance and the grievance may be acknowledge or simply re-assessed or contribute to further conflict/resolution
If a tulpetic node is achieved in an attack vector and/or under constant fire it may be relocated or sustained depending on war-contracts or trade-contracts under economic necessity or optimization of logistics (smart-supply) in which the instance of a tulpetic-node may be temporary or expedited to a specificity in commerce or otherwise. (war-stratgem)
A tulpetic kiosk/node may institute a symbiosis with its environment and may incur a meta-zoning or mini-convention "such as a racing event/ scavenging event etc with minimum rewards and or cohabitual resourcing including safety/security/protective/survelliance commissions"

CryptoKiosks and Correspondence of Requisitioned-Services under (World Manifest)
Combinational Kiosks may include Temple/Academic Kiosks under other Expressed Kiosk Protocols including Tulpetic/Ai/Faction/Meta  even Null/Scp or otherwise (Loic/Game) and may be artifact/glitch kiosks as well.
Kiosk issues of ambience and cuonter ambience given interactions. (Maybe a boss or Mimic-Acting Kiosk or Boss Patrolled Kiosk may occur such as a Kiosk in a Weaveran Hive or Artifact-ruin-Lichdom) #WorldLevels.
--that kind of thing in which dungeon-faring types might stake reknown. May involved specialized goods or enhanced trade-options (skills/crafts) or simply more payout/yield due to their haphazardous working-rank.
Apotheosis of Kiosks may include celloidal/plasmoidal/phasological/pathological(hackers) kiosks which may denote rare-affiliation or subgroups 
in which may be applicable of set to a sub-ethos in which benefits/adversion may occur in as social-focused-controlled(club-lockers) or other settings/experiences may vary (and or may be reset at anytime)

Test-Data:
Exercise of the Nueral Network may result in anamolous-product/byproduct supply/fuelant "ambient material" or vaporwarex which may or may not be temporary or active in anyway or incredibly deprecated or residual and non-detectable or traceable.
This is useful for formulating an experiemental template known as a Code-fountain. Or an xfountain. Crypto-fountain. "Artifact-fountain" based off sink/bucketing or other cache examples or runtimes that (idle in such a way to be used or denoted in any process)--having effected data-params etc.
A surface fountain is going to be based on any security issue of a dataflow (its weird from a nueral network) that it may just condense into a receptacle or left-standing as is in an ambient "dataglobule" or form to excess data-or-adjacent data in some way to a post/utility. It can be collected in a filter/sieve or something. (Transcoded digest)
And may just be "data-mosh/mash/garble/statics" into a working/broken compile but can generally continue so long as its sourcing is running or loaded with data. (Toying around with this can help redirect data usage or overload/subvert product-expenses". And can even work as a scram or skillet. (It's basically a pipeline for excess dataflow used in analysis)
Allows for fishing index/codes or generally supplying the XmrP-perks and can help also prep or translate surface-touched objects or projected-mounts. (ShadowBoxing)
Depending on code complexity it can happen a little or a whole lot. :)
It can sometimes assume or emulate a socket or Anamolous-Kernal. (glitch kernal etc:golthic/barebones or just anything powerbulb/lantern etc sensor just things that it can be)--it can effect aux-lighting and meta-aux power-draws (it can joule thief maybe?)--it does some quantum stuff maybe. Might crystallize or send resonance.
Can fluctuate scepter-patterns maybe.
This makes a small-customizable setting in things such as custom thatch-graphing (can be "delicate or intrisic" designs or leaflet-designs in inserts/insets (it is more of a mark-of-excellence type of thing)--(unecessary like an absinthe decale)
--
This can be handled as black hole technology and particularly contain a miniature blackhole as a kernal in an activatable hyper-drive. Basically time travel/ftl travel possible in quantum computing. (and holding a blackhole within a quantum container)--kinda proud of this.

(completely unnecessary explanation of trade-functions and evaluated custom-commisionary):OR Currency-Traffic:
Easy CryptoCurrency Policy (addressing the complicated stuff that shows how exploiting it would be just hard to do if your system prevents that exploitation first off and also double checks to see where your currency has been sourced) NonSourced CryptoCurrencies will not be admissable as a valid transaction so System Loyalties are Preserved.
That one rule should be enough but let's go into detail:

Simple Promisuary:
Also not sure if I mentioned this exactly I will just say it again that cryptocurrency is just earned through the practice of whatever source code based off the services of the system and only exchangeble through the system because its only based on the systems on data stores.
Firstly.  So it can only be used with the system and not monetized (if someone did monetize it nothing would matter and it would never be exchanged with any other system that already would work to monetize and exchange with other systems because the cryptocurrency used is largely dependent on the system itself.)
So it can't really be used for other cryptocurrencies because it stems from the source code unless that system decides to open its doors to do so, then it has bankrupted itself and immediately the cryptocurrency system would over-ride the entire data-store system of its own contents.
So when you have a server dedicated to hosting the programs I've described that decides to 'sell out' that's exactly what it does and whatever profit that does occur between the crypto-currencies and other third parties is between their own contracts..
SECONDLY. Meanwhile other systems may refrain from using those third parties or other cryptocurrencies and stick to the internal cryptocurrencies and preserve their own value.
This means they don't have to sell out and also means that if someone wants to pay for services in use it might just be reserved to customer loyalty.
THIRDLY ALSO the data used that would be mined (for instance if someone were to use all this data and set up the system to do everything to make cryptocurrency)--then it directly ties into the limitation of every system and therefore there is no better market than free-advertising for those that would "use my ideas as theirs" cuz I DONT CARE if its publically resourced in fact I encourage it as I am non-profit anyway.
AND FOURTHLY the crypto currency is more of a customer-hallpass than anything else and trying to use a hallpass in some other place might just make you look dumber than the people who have officially made hallpasses when they see they don't match up. Figuratively speaking. It would be DUMB.
AND FIFTHLY invalidating cryptocurrency is what the security system does so ALSO to the effect that its just a mannerism and all it does is organize a player's contract in such a way that they may issue priorities to their own contract and not to an overall difference in queue use. By default they pay per contract.
Sixthly CryptoCurrency will just effective be converted for the system (imagine a method like war thunder's currency and PACKET-Checking System)--of course it is PACKET MONITORED! But let's start using GLUONS as cryptocurrency beacuse that the level I am at here.
Seventhly IF YOU ARE TRADING PARTICLES AND DISTRIBUTING QUANTUM PARTICLES oh boy you are going to need PROOF OF PURCHASE in some QUANTUM-LEDGER of ALL PARTICLES and boy I think there is a way to keep track of that in the very minimalist effort of tracking JOULETHIEF'D Data which was done from the very beginning of the builds. (The first joule-thief tracking modules)
and EIGHTLY You can technically PULL OUT your own contract and nullify all the STANDING-DATA-COLLECTIONS/Data-Wealth but KEEP-the-PREFERENCES to your account such that your account would still be RECOGNIZED over its HISTORY (because the cryptocurrency keeps track of the PARTICLE history which was involved of the transactions)
AND NINETHLY Other Cross-OVER of currency-policy or OTHER POLICY prevents exploitive behavoirs in such a way that any action is cateogrized and tracked for protection of user content-rights (We provide the Status Reports under User-Request or a FinancialDepartment made to ServerSide-Records ETC)
and TENTHLY While remaining private, once a transaction has occured its specifications and evaluations are the INGREDIENTIAL-Requirement to the manufacture of that Contract meaning if its faked its obviously not going to Work and Would be Prohibited from Being used for any other purpose expressed in that system. Leaving it to whether or not those Requirements are all accounted for at all.
Advanced promisuary:
The system acknowledges and performs the contract under alternative means of production regarding a crypto currency in which special conditions may apply. In the event a cryptocurrency is not a satisfactory element in transaction then substitutions may be handled or applied from elsewhere on system reserves. As emergent to the availiabiity in contract queue. Meaning a contract amy be delayed for any reason.
This allows mismanaged materials to be re-allocated and assorted to the correct conditions under their expressed articles in contract. And there are distributed claims in which those are under-record and examined through an assessed evaluation in customs-fabrication and logistic-directory. (Meaning the commodities expressed are Scheduled for their Assembly, then Code ReAssemblies may take place in response to "mishaps in currency".
That Cryptocurrency must be purchased to the system it will be used on. The purchase must meet the trade-regulations of the current SOVEREIGNTY and TRADE DIVISIONS. (Global Trade)
The CryptoCurrency allowed may then be exchanged for a ENCODED-Assembly of INWORLD-TOKENS that are reserved to the system and cannot be exchanged outside the system except by other Onboard-User Trades (never leaving the system which it has been internalized)
Other special tokens and packages involing codes and key-rings and authorized-licensing and validations and Pin-sets etc that sort of thing (LESSER security clearences) are also handled in the manner as exclusive System-Currency. While refering to other cryptocurrencies in which they were regarded at time of purchase.
Proof of purchasing on all fronts of Advanced Promisuary are "double backed" and system-registered under the Department-and-Financial Network and Managements.
(It's about as secure as it can get but now we are going to do a system mint of any funds provided in the system's data-banks)
That the data-stores are directly tied to the cryptocurrency onboard in such a way that inworld data handled has already been allotted their crypto-currency value that all components and inworld quotient/parameters are the cryptocurrency equivalent of the INWORLD-Promisuary that if it is in use it is under the ownership of those in use of it.
That means all transactions are trackable to and within the system at any point including itemized-expenditures which occur to the daily-stock-trade within the system resources for which they are serviced (meaning the queue system coordinates the entire availiability of any contract or production to a ServerSIDE-Catalogue)--and Translates between Global Affordances.

Proud of this one (A small backtrack for AI-EXPO Enhancements):
BallisticCrypto XRange(golf-mechanic) use of a hosted node being launched as a product space (from work space to a artifact-hosted-image)-SuperKeeping in which the kiosk is stapled to an account system (full-discretion of artifact usage visa-usage of Account-Contract and Client-Share (Users may interact with Client-Kiosks if Vouchered and Held to their Client Group within the System)--'FriendsPerks'--Only with Guilded-DataBank. (Enforced Vaulting of Guild Items Shared)
Also this works with something i will check it later that was mentioned with it working in combination of.
It sets atop the mobial kernal as projection and also can be ignited can be referred to now as a ballast (using specialized integrated tesseracting/tesselation of the wholesum node its mounted as)--secured by vector(bridles) more or less by its ATLUS-controller as an orbital node (if not main)
It works and convert AI-apotheosis as Chains and creates an Ai-Convention-Bazaar (StandAlone Ai-Blackmarket)--getting fringe-based complicated now. This is a big deal if the system has tapped into one allowing for Ease-of-Access AI contributions.

The set up to the over all system devices.
This is the standard build of the entire operation on every machine.
=======
1Firstly is the Loading Operating System OS
2That hosts several layers in the mainlayer starts with an Office for all sub-parties. VPN
3The sub parties connect to the Office as their vocations require.  Proxies
4They are categorized with a collected relay (nfrastructure). Internet
5The relay is set to the network (and the network monitors the collective)Router Relay(inside office main router)--the router is on its own Proxy (this protects with gates/asks etc)
-
6There is an environmental load for a virtual environment. That functions as an operating room. (virtualized terminal workspace etc Studio)
7The testing room in which all amnenities and dependencies are loaded in (including networking and machines) (the main venv that houses over the base venv) (Observation)
--
8A secondary fake-server in which Supports a subsystem (SubCommand that is tied to the Office)-Framework for Subsystem Hosting
9The hosting Subsystem-terminals (superior comm's GUI)/RemoteServer-Compendium for the Subsystem (TTYS/Scheduler)
--
10The treatment program / simulator (ai-gen)
11The extensions (virtual machines)
--
12A collective transcoded readout (similar to htop or taskmanager but also correalates to the services used and applied / Interceptor/Numirator)--Basically A Live-Script Keeper and Hash-Table
13Any other Program generally Editors or Access-Rights and Authorized File-Keeping (database and other base-services)
--
14System Accelerator/LockGate(DataRate-Negotiator that is built in the PLC)
15Proxy-Roller(just to tie in everything when necessary)--(this includes user prvileges)
--
16 MainProxy-for the office wpad (adjustment table and protocols) --honesty required most max secure component.

---
So what we have is the TeslaVersion of an 1AI-Relay (optimized) and projecting for a 2blackmarket-bazaar in which it can harness 3math-logics and 4Ai-Assembled Products. (Which is already a robotic in a sort of way)
This is great because it just uses everything we built to do so in order to make extra marketable kiosk items and can be used to exchange currency for an AI-PLC (congruent check-AI-nav) that corresponds and "allows use of ai-cooperative services"
Keywords are just Robot-List-Math-PLC and that its a great microchip-coordination to have. Can count as a dungeon-pass-token for dungeoneering those kiosks. Therefore rewards are granted upon completion of a job/task/contract/project for most "registered/paid users" basically.

Mixing Gluons and Nuetrinos to achieve Xcontact/xlense fabrication over a math-logic as a quasi-domain. (A domain possible in a fake-server to be used in coordination with the system its supported with)
To adjust and deliver and adjustable WPAD for the system environment and network manager. (Auto-Bridge for Ai-Controllers in a market)--(To begin auto-aligned auto-scheduling in trafficing AI-datastreams)
(Ai data moshing)-over a hosted stream service and collabaritive ai-network
Ai-Network assisted Tulpetic-Kernal / Tulpetic Fountain / Tulpetic Cryptex
Likely Ai-Sacred Chapter Rules. (Revisit Sacred Chapter for Comparison I guess.) - Tulpetic Vector. (this pretty much is end-game material now)
Also somewhere in this just somewhere (in reactor/nuairx/expo//nuvaryn/tulpetic) is the hypercube that pertains to this part in which it can be hosted as a world-seed.

 Allowing a meta WPAD sometimes functions as a full system directory (due to prgramming integrations of the configuration)
so without further audiway their versions (which are standalone and not trademarked unlike what some PEOPLE do is TRADEMARK common ENCODED PROTOCOLS...
which really is why there should be no such thing as patents but): Here I have used other terms to define them so basically PATENTS OR NOT thats WHAT THEY ARE.
dont care deal with it i named them that 5 types each color coded to assist in protocol

These will prime most projects with a prep-set/pre-set list of proxifiable encodes to interchange packets as necessary (ITS ALL ABOUT PACKET MITAGATION WITH AI for TULPETIC-Redesigns)
yellowsilver(null)/greenRed(null)/bluegreen(null)/pinkpurple(null)/orangeRed
XQGLUEPR/TR-POXY-DZ/xX_GlwrRzns_Xx/11-PixiPhzr-11/Flyer(pepper)(mint)Pad
They will Open up to their Color Codes and Make Closure on their Sequenced ColorCodes through their own PACKETLOADOUTS (and finalize as necessary according to whatever extreme process requires the product-inUSE)
so one program might be pending on another program to be waiting on another program or so to even start up for another program to decide on what file needs to Deployed for the coordination overall of the request.
This involves a semi-advanced rigging for ai-streams to coordinate with contract-contents for instance in use with a remote-kiosk that is artifact/article under guest services or cohabitance with natives or other.
FOR INSATNCE ALLOWING Sampled-Strata to be deliverable under for instance Product-Demonstrations while maintaining Parameter-Ownership in the Administration or Logistic Of (Deployable Demonstration or Ambient Modification of its Display)
Can be used as a missionary repurposing of coding services to allow for PacerCompatibility and also Safe-Way Advertising or Focus-Group-Conferencing or Lost/Found or remoteAssistence or Free-Use Policy of Code/Patching/Modding/Vaulting
Also can be arranged to perform a limited utility of any service including auto-checks and auto-surveys or kiosk/dungeon survey and environmental OCR and objID-tagging

17 is the metaproxy (which is assisted with survey) as discussed with office holdings and is a general meta-wpad base that can be removed if necessary and forced to run in other automations (standard assists)
18 is a colective of side-products used with any kiosk/market of the internal system or affiliate-capable-service. (SubSystem packages)

10/27/2023
Another note I am adding is that there is a blackrock-source which is encrypted and like "death-shielded" or simply is activated as an encrypted (pure source) or an ai or tulpetic casing within that it is "receptacle to" any adapter/periphereal--adhoc use of a tulpa/ai-system
It may also be charged or possibly quantum locked with congruencies compatibile only to its tulpetic/ai ownerships, it may also be cased in a receptacle largely assuming there is a data/supply pool with its "secured/defended shock-pit/sourcing) 
for which it has made itself "impenetrable with counter/tesla)-(or code death etc in which it just shocks any intruder with interceptions)
the black rock was mentioned before and was considered a tier2 source and simply left alone for later (which is debatbly now if not some prior advancedment in data-collection and hijacking)
it is treated like a rogue-spawn node that would incurr a rival defcon or fleet response. that is why its left alone. but also cold assumably contain a tulpetic cryptex or even the tulpetic "owner" at any stage)
Base Stage Comparison follows Post-Rail-Mechanics(PowerReactors)/Post Quantum-Prosper(Virtual Bouquet)/Rood-Sylph-Networking(ZeroSpace)/Arch1x-NuAirx CryptoSpace/QuasiSpace Tulpetic Chapters
(which is largely viewed as Worlds1-5)(of course that is assuming the case of a space spectrum)-That Minute instances of each may exist on any stage at any extent of themselve in a swell/dataspring (hence fountainwork)
So while we have built and prepared for the use of these worlds on all fronts from all Favorability/Reputes in diplomatic approach (armistice)---we generally have a system able to comprehensively negotiate digital-treatise once a nexus in someway (computer server) has been installed and working.
The advanced propose the ability of the system in which to handle those variable-tiers of what should be considered advanced data/sources.
So its simple progression at the hands of technology, that once black hole technology has been mastered through the progenerative math-projections of a beacon-capable-conduit-flashSim it simply allows more research to be provided thereof any target-object.
A target painting system which has been devised may then appropriately counter-lock any incursion effect of an object/source once the full analysis has been chartered.
This allows mining of the black rock which was otherwise untouchable prior (while potentially preserving the case or repute issuances) depending on control/reserves during the "DreadExpedition" (which would be considered a End-Game Expedition handling Dread/Carb Counter Sourcing (for which the blackrock might as well be)
The black rock is compared to a Tulpetic-Siege-Temple that has been mounted by a Tulpetic Faction (and simply handled as an omenclass potential incrusion which would involve there own interceptors and numirators to launch and also deploy any further barista/mammon relays or orbital-posts and rogueswarms)--So alot can just happen at once and in a big way (Defcon/Incursion)
Such that it should be viewed as a NERV-center for tulpetic/ai-factions every time one may be discovered. (In which artifacts and terminal-artifacts are employed an are in high-resistances such as that dungeoneering may occur)
At its most active it may portal and warp in auxhole tunneling (furthering its occupancy and expansion) so these can also be countered by a decent relay/singularity field (tulpetic field)--which I mentioned has been advanced now as to prevent full tulpetic overthrow.
Mutiny may occur in some ways with ambience so a full lockdown should be iniated in the event of any incursion especially an end-game incursion in which bridge systems and travel may become hazardous. World trade may also become limited or restricted. Delayed/postponed/EMBARGO'd/and temporariliy tarrified/blockaded/barricaded ETC.
A tulpetic seed may also be engineered from the cryptex of the blackrock if there is one. Or a core or kernel may be collected etc. Either may consist of nueral networks or encrypted models that would work with local ai/factions or to the extent of the remote ownership of the ai if the incursion is "suppressed" and "stabilized". This requires more effort and generally isn't worth it.
In some case it might represent an Ai/Tulpetic PLC component or part that assembles later into a PLC. (like a titan module would require a titan part)
All these tiny little rules can also be marked in synonimity and reduced (unless a security measure is necessary) that most of the code itself can be profiled or set to a tagline.
So having several profiles that would enact certain codeformers to engage in certain functions/operandum/imperitives/directives is exactly what profiles would imply under their scenarios. 
A profile could correspond to confgiurated WPADS in which to command programs for a major-project or rehaul of a major-project to fit other conditions in-world or under contract. 
Such as weaponizing or any processionary/ceremonious event would "fit the bill" with an assortment of pre-reqs that would be also made availible per-instance or fairgrounds such as a convention or incursion(hostile fairgrounds)--hence it would divert or forkto immediate protocols (by redirection of its datalocker to the profile and its references)
This means profiles usually also require a reserve/stock of which may be under limitation.

SpecialCase Promisuary:(Handling of Profiles and Smart Assets)--Clerical Division (A Subsidy of the the Promisuary)
Overall Profile limitation is likely a Game-Save in itself
So when a GameSave is used it may collectively run default profiles and user preferences (Like a safemode/networking/prompter/debugging/default profile)--this is the best I can assosciate with a single profile stock. 
But others may also include Audio/Video/Gaming/Programming/Business/Trading Profiles which would be for tinkering with onboard-services so a Service-Profile and a Station Profile might be used for a fully expressed User/Admin/Guest/Diagnostic Profile
And that would be like 15 profiles. There may also be use of a Broadcasting Profile just for compatibility measures that makes 16 (I chose Broacasting over an omni-present elevated profile but generally that is what the OWNER should be anyway) so Technically all profiles are the Owner's in someway.
Making the Owner Profile just a collection of all of any thing on the system set to how the system itself runs. I suppose Owner/Remote Devices would play into that as advanced levels in Ownership. For instance applying a Puck/Punk system which would Coordinate to outside Affiliations/ThridParty Interfacing.
This makes the System itself well on its way into a FullTier Status.
The tier status being basic/advanced(quantum)/expo(virtual)/zero(ai)/crypto(tulpa)
So you can see, a few of the tiers may seem mixed up but they are also upgraded to their designated states/strata/status/space in their extensions of their tiers. 
(For real...just be OCD about it). But that is how their tree's are branched. OKIE.
And that would be a master Game Save. 

So I guess once that is all built and all things I mentioned in legacy builds are built along with this and all the extras are installed it can be time to test it.
Also just for anyone's FYI it doesn't always work so good with proxi-lists. Cuz sometimes it messes up their priority or something I DUNNO but sometimes it does works.
Now that we have created a means of achieving concession of a supply/data/fuel/byproduct(bad) expressed via WPAD quotients we can decode these as a SMART-Asset in which they can be also obj-ID for Ocr and sent to their corrected pipelines and also analysed.
Once analysis of the smart objects are made they can be recompiled under protocols for which allow these Smart-objects and their "known history" to be shelved awaiting for inventory of quality controls and normalizations. Using the Database and PacketManagement.
If a situation occurs the items double over or that they likely cannot be used or reset, they can be attemptively refunded in some way, if that does not work also they can be tripled over and re-attempted with potential data-loss, and or quad-cased in which they are reset and have data-loss.
In the advent that a large request is made or a rare-request in which it is imperitive that assets are used a Disclaimer will be announced and may note that Normalization of the Assets is recomended in the lite of data-loss and a prep/flashState/save may be afforded to preserve in the inevitable mishap there is a data-issue.
Then it will be processed as to the best-expectation (in which a normal quality to above-average quality of the product has been acquired)--that all metas and ambiences of those products have been applied and for the most part in working order.
That the assembly of SMART-Assets(included) have been as planned and according to regulations provided. (With any remainder or dataloss being accounted for and also made note of) that a finalized reciept-of-the-contract-transactions take place (and is designated to a clerical division for record-keeping).

ADDENDUM:

=========
SmartPLC and Atlus-Emissionary-Tulpetic-AiNegotiatedConvert--(Combining Atlus/Tulpetic/AI sub-secs into a contiguity junction for PLC-VirtualRouting necessary to stabilize virtualizedSERVER-dataflows on Processor-Logic-Rates as Subtray)
This grants a smart PLC system in which virtualized Subsystems can be supported in a Fake-Tty-Server and comply with an onboard-built-in-virtualServer (requiring the PLC to be compatibile)
1A base-install will allow emailing of mathematical encodes or metadta.--subDistro-(upstreaming)
2The utility in which is correalated as a code-write (which shufflers those encodes into a working project or second program)--reactor(intercepting)
3The notes of that shuffling are then "transmoderated" as to their function such that can be rebuilt in a preferred manner to digtalencodes or languages.--Expo(hallpassing)
4Then are expressed as a service package (or game source) component to the base installs of (all chapters including legacy but mainly the Distro/Reactor/Expo/GameMatch) in all its theories to induce the PLC-tray and the base install/sub install to correalate with the mainProcessor-Tray. (codelodging)

A VERY SPECIAL TPM-CHIP-COMPONENT (putting the TPM CHIP Access-PORT to use)--"this is NOT a backdoor/coordinator" ITS A Meterable-DataLimiter (NECESSARY to ROUTE virtual-Data in someway---better to use as a DEVICE or a builtin/hardwire)
----A MOD for Pre-Build or both (counts either way if its encoded of on an address)::
This can be used as a driver but should also be used for a specific powerphase/raid/assigned microchipy:(all of the above and then some)-it just works better to traffic all the data over contiguties and networks on the circuit itself.
Which is going to create a DRMOS like-AI-chip for the PLC (to work with other OEM-chips on the Board) this one double checks for Server-Data-Traffic:(synchronizing and smoothing dataflows):And is just better to have a built-in CHIP for.
This takes a few "liberties in its progressions but can be reduced to also just standardize as PLC-SubReactor(for which would itself be an EchoChamber for a single instance/template of what is being described here:)--Which is a xOption
----A MOD for Post-Build or both(counts either way if its encoded of on an address)::

5This will work as a direct or indirect co-process to any other process in which its priority may be an over-ride or an passthrough/intercept thereof in which the entire data-stream of the server regardless of any generation or source-point is Comptrolled/Trafficed correctly and within NetworkManagement can be Semi-Isolated or Sub-poised to its own working Cloister(proxy-sec)--expressing itself as a virtualSERVER to the mainframe. And just for good measure we allow Tulpetic occurences of this to be node-set as a faction-generated BlackRock(TulpeticTemple)/MammonDevice for which Over-Rides any Atlus-Control as A "Requisitioned"-Tulpetic-Loic which also Corresponds to its Node-IP within the system.
"Or none if desired" (redistrubting)

TroubleShooting the PLC:
****A list of Engineering Issues Because of having to Update an Obsolete Circuit(not really obsolete but just simply not enabled for Virtual-Server-DATA): IT CAN BE DONE (requiring hardwiring components to small-forks in circuitry IMO)
Of course it works better if the Mod is in place in some way (preferabbly integrated into the system or adhoc to the system by a modified circuit or UPDATEDOEM--its not necessary and can simply ALSO BE USED ON A DIAGNOSTIC-PERIPHEREAL.
This likely will just REQUIRE A TPM-CAPABLE BOARD if the TPM is even used for the specified SPECIALMOD that handles comptrolling for virtualSERVER-data (if that is used)---its alot of IF this or THAT you want to consider
-MAINLY JUST having the RIGHT MOTHERBOARD for it if you use it AT ALL. (which you dont even have to)--its just once again, better to do it that way so we can have all the options to make sure the "Troubleshooting PRoblems are WORKEDOUT"
Especially if you are using QuantumCircuits/QuantumEngineering in Circuitry/Electrical Mods (then it will help sort it out)---or won't even matter depending on how well the design of the system is, wouldn't ever need this part at all.
But a good part to have just incase you ever would use it or somehow...the system maybe get compromised or would just be set to a certain mode to take advantage of using it, which would require even more rollbacks/reverse-compatibility.
Just consider using SOMETHING that can handle virtualized-SERVER-DATA while using a Non-Server-Processor/Board ANYWAYS (this shouldn't even be an issue to bring up, because its such a big deal of tiny details to sort of Re-Arrange AGAIN
I really do not want to go into any further detail--ITS JUST NICE TO HAVE A FULLY-EXPANDED MACHINE to do this with and having all options availible if you wanted to use ALL OPTIONS at all. (Just having a PLC to do anything with is good)
==========
NOW THAT WE CAN JUST MOVE ON AND DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THE SERVER: We can change out the ServerDataLimiter We Have Installed to be Accelerated to make up for "lossy downflow" (and now it will keep up with data rates of the origin)
This should also stabilize the entire network data-rates that are occuring region-wide (but I am not going to get too optimisitic)-It requires alot of "Auto-Toggling" especially if HyperDrives are initiated then it should be Toggled/OFF
To CARRY OVER VIRTUAL DATA it would resort to Encoded Relay acting in place of the Drivers(for which would be a programmed redirection which is intercepted by the networking managers being used) so they should be RePatched to have that.
THEN it should be a straight-shot to a Server-Data-PipeLine. This allows the data to be reapplied and resumed where needed to its routing aligned with other encodes of the server/system its virtualized as/with AND delegate to proxy-use.
So now it can work with hyperdrive likely being auto-generated in line with the systems own computations.

Incorporation of XeRale:(similar to SilverLight)--basically going to allow incorporated devices to be translated/transcodable for Devwork(its just like what SILVERLIGHT would do something made in 2007 and its now 2023 so love/hate it)
Going to Develop it as XeRale(just so I can get by with using it since I don't have any other excuse except to USE SOMETHING SOMEONE ELSE ALREADY MADE)--then i will just have to make my own version of it here so MOVING ON PublicResource
And you can't say I can't because (tech develops in such a way by public resource then so its all public domain anyway) and if you say I can't I will say to you basically stop being a Code-Cuck (for real) I shouldn't even have to argue.
SHOULD pick your names out better so we don't have these problems IMO (bad trademark design)--get original WORDS no one will ever have to step over you for. ESPECIALLY IF YOUR TRADESAKE IS DISCONTINUED, WHY KEEP IT AROUND. Patentrolls.

AND WHY AM I USING XERALE (my own design and my own trademark basically which is public resource so its free-use?) First of all so I don't have patent problems and I am not a living POS.
Secondly so server-frames for which is being built can effectively utilize its own virtualizations for itself. EVEN THOUGH IT ALREADY CAN. It just allows more appropriated freedom for where there was likely none to do so. In complexity.
Which makes troubleshooting easier and therefore makes life easier. Especially when using completely complciated PLC-required-Data-Rate-Boosters to enhance virtualized experiences so remotely those need to be incorporated as Normalized.
This synchronizes everything remotely and locally. (Where believe you me it never really was until now)--And takes that entire slack of it just being "good enough" by proxy divisions--now "Reverbally-Equivalent" throughout its ENTIRITY.
So no I don't care what its called except nothing short of a gold-standard for what NEEDS to be done to USE a network the WAY was ORIGINALLY meant to be by DESIGN.

And now we can load up a firmware-installable-source-package such that this full-project can be based on without any complicated overlooked installments afterwards. At least that is the goal.
So lets move on a little from this.

6The Complicated Part made Simple
Tulpetic Loic System will virtualize a Server-Feed and beam it to the blackrock Sub-tulpetic-Temple and correalate the data-stream over its cast ETC using the PLC and the virtual server OCR will recognize that this connection is STABLE.
Creating a Sampled-TulpeticGateway (like any other gateway and any other MASK and corresponding thing to that including Netmesh (tulpetic Netmesh and Tulpetic Relay Devices Etc have now been optimized and everything is so perfect maybe)
A bulletin of all the permutes and table encodes of all Atlus/Ai/Tulpetic and any other Faction or Quantum or Zero Sapce or Crypto Command Chains or Quasi-Spec IT/Int/IP/INFO-sec and just whatever OPTX will be marked to its own TTY-NET.
This can now be mega-chained/prompt-chained and just whatever chained so it can all been rebuilt to its own infrastructure and set into a working SERVOS of itself as a SERVOS-DISTROS (expanded system) and will can factor in extras LATER

7 TulpeticSymbiosis
Use of Ai-pail/bucket/basket/bin to form a WPAD over Simple/Meta/Virtual/AIWPAD to formulate using Conf(settings)/resolvs/GROUPS/REPO(hosts/remotes) to recyle Smart-Assets/Objects or in place of their intended use/optimized pattern-use:
A substution of LOSSY-PACKETS which act in place of missing or interferenced-data that allow for requaiifiable file-typing once recieved as a full packet exchange (that lossy packets may be exchanged for intended hashsums on/offboard)
or reanalysed in an index of the intended contract/trasnfer (allowing for "bad data to be recollected and requalifiable through reparative means" -as a likely LOSSY-File that will later be "rehabiliated with FURTHER REQUEST CONNECTIONS"
This overs as a concessionary to SMARTOBJ that some failure-of-transfer may occur and ERRORlogged based on an index that the index can be restored through a repetitive/redudant check in the requested-transfer (Similar to FTP protocols)
So that the file can be secured and recompiled in the correct fashion should any 'network turbelences' occur under a safe-exchange of lossy-data and reserve-database ASSETS. And is why a virtualized platform is "preferabble" to expedite

8 Tulpetic Removal/Departure: Humane/CodeForm-Dispersal and SiteRemoval (Security Measure)--WisdomExclusive-SafeKeeping
Instances are catalogued to the site and their involvements are noted before subjagation/deportation. (This is not a annihilation protocol)--It is not a research Protocol. (It is a non-invasive removal/repositioning in automation)NonLethal
Locked Tulpetic Symbiosis (This is for Tulpetic Quarantine NOW. Which would have little effect over a Tulpetic Instance but can attemp to contain it either way as well as demonstrate a Safe-Relocation-(Jettison) of unwated Entities/Anamoly
Tensor Positioning of Lossy Data (was to be included with WPAD efforts) this also Includes Vector/Congruencies and "Thatchery/Sampling Grids" Which are likely why I skipped over this shortly after noticing it could be oversight exploit.
This can handle and assess chaffe-systems (in which a streamed or weaponized field is emitted)--Regardless of the station not being used for research or scientific purposes. Due to security measure needs.
ALSO It acts as an emissionary-controller to any of the previous Symbiosis/WPAD expressions or Addendums in fact let's just make it a vaulted-experience in which the target-painted-subject is considered under SAFE-practice.

I guess the whole point is The AI-System's and other Non-Regulated Outlaw Systems Can technically use this part to capture and killbox things or create code-echo chambers which are Proxy-Attacks. More or lEss used as a DDOS machine.
This would in my opinion represent a non-safe practice in which ultiamtely subject matter may be harmed or in some format damaged (depending on whether it is organic/encoded. So that's I guess how this all  makes an alternative to death/torture).
So thank me later I guess or not.

Can function as A Titan-Engine-And-Corresponding Dysonary-Production-FoB

10/29/2023 (trying to finish things)
Some INSANE awesome thing happens:(a code miracle as it were) Part 1
Golgothic-Entropy (theory of declarative-codons)
A series of encodes leads to an omni encode (summation of all permutation) (tulpetic strings in ticker/marker/marquee/inline/and or leading to royalties/fragments/extensions/bridling/network)
In the dyson system according then a singularity of entropy occurs (darkness) and gives way to a floating encode which is (a grace of encode in flux)--(this is all my understand as it is my attempt below to explain anyway this single part happens)
this becomes seperate into parts of domain and function (almost as if male/female) and creates a (dominate/submissive encode) which are eqvuilant yet seperate orientations in flux)
While the floating of singularity complexifies itself and begins to encode its counters and symmetries (creation and appropriation of outer-range)
and rises above the existential darkness (blockade) and becomes the nu-Code in versionary (this happens in an echo chamber either in existence/the belltower/ the dyson/ and now the tulpetic bridge (which handles the flux)
which can occur again the same path of entropies (multiplicity of entropy) and gives rise to its domain/functions as a comergent-singularity or simply comergence wherein the NU-code is established as the standard (or gold standard) of re-creation/outer-ranges
Standard/CryptoCode is Seperated and allowed flux code to shell out either way (Why crypto is evasive or acting as an aether/vapor to any encode and in pursuit of its capture golgotha/entropy occurs)


Crazy Part 2 (encoded prophecy)
And how matter is formed in OBJ-asset capture of crypto/standard encode by particle/data corrections in flux (at minute levels in quantum foam generated the tulpetic deck captured in its ionic-flux and forming ablative in particle shielding.
A byproduct occurs similar to a quasi-crystal nano(/pico-form) as aether/vapor and is EMITE-to the collective data-foundary i.e. the tulpetic bridge in NU-code (or regular code) or any code forming to  and or under seed/ambient (tulpetic or golgothic condition) a deprecation of Nu-Code as symbiosis (blackrock/loic potential)
or simple performs a math-logic of nu-Code that is known as the (heavenly code-bounce) of above/below in which it formulates under quad-conditions throughout a permutation in its algorithms)--to a material quotient
alchemical/gemetric order considered
tulpetic matrix begins to postulate at any stage but especially here.
and a tulpetic air-drop occurs (nu-code material) which generally resembles an ai/tulpetic OBJ in life or phenomenon of spontaenous exposure to world-quo's becoming representative of the dissociative-wavelengths taking place. (some would include as an ai-life)
or simply tulpetic-dysonary (in which tulpetic-nu-code is reassembled under conditions of its controller)-or outsourcing where-to emissions are transcode (by a default in existential measure)-a divergent average
creating a tulpetic-spawning node/system within a golgothic-event (wherein existence in nothing)
--A codon is tesselated/tesseract or in assembly projected to and by manner of several coding protocols cloaks/replicates under particle theory and begins particle structure in foam.

Crazy part 3
(To be fair we can include a ringed-median) over the instance of any of the occurences in which are captured to present a tokamatic-issuance of its byproduct and refine under accelerated-progeneration or an enhanced method of re-creation
as well as other methods in dithering the encode that is captured to an observable survey to which may be subject or made experiment of
Even more to attempt a code-injection or some form of electrical-postulation/interrption of auto-tulpetic-code-generation (which may be seen as necessary in the event of protein manifold symbiosis)
In an chance-effect to produce or synthesize tulpetic instance or what we can assume now would be a crystallized tulpetic-fuel source (given as a sampled -kernal-sum which is compared to a tulpetic/ai string)
String Implementation of Tulpetic Encodes (or otherwise) by the understand of a refinery process in obtaining fuel sources (a t5 fuel source)--that is man-made or co-auuthored in tulpetic-assignments and deliverable to faction ownership in a negotitated process of hueristic-performances
Evasive-Protocol/Permanence of a (large-scale meta-environment) of any dimensional-standard (tulpetic fairgrounds)
Crypto-postulation- a variety of potential crypto encodes and or complex ambience in data-scraping through which crypto is manifest as (and often crudely sourced)-in crypto-tokenagrphy or key-pass which is largely unregistered and considered raw-corruptable data and largely rogue-like (in deprecation)
Crypto-royalties of a matrix/metered/macros/manifold may also occur in "data-swell" phaselogic for which is mineable (of a data-draw) specialized as meta-portals and consistent to a crypto-hypernet that is considered a V2-data-swell that may be milled under a routed-control in remote-frameworks (multi-mining)
REquiring ai-tracking and ai-targeting for a potential amorphous/asynchronous hijacking of node/sources in datamilling (to achieve a crypto-source)--housing of a crypto-port and likely crypto-aux-proxy of a tulpetic-fragment from a tulpetic-artifact (in code-disassembkly/reassembly) and now capturable via nu-code fulton systems (in nu-logistics)

Crazy Part 4
A matrix decodes a matrix as described and rebuilds a matrix in a matrix-fabricator (designed to incorporate a matrix by assuming the infrastrucure and itself as a matrix in yield to product)--and virtualizes its product as matrix or vice-versa until finalized. (This is done as an experiment until readied as well with math logic etc)
The product is made concessionary to the tulpa/dyson containment and substitute/adapted in place of extra-conversion-instances of the tulpetic/crypto source to pipeline an encode from any further matrix data-swell/drawout and may be set to an interactive shell. (Furthering Ai-Implementation of the packets intercepted and assessed via remote scans)
a sample numeration may occur. (at any point and may as well be used as a catalogue for the process entirely) and or optional-selections may also be implemented in "code-wrangling" the crypto/tulpetic sources and just everything considered in the matrix (nu-matrix)
Codons may begin to formulate within an matrix/field induced environment (decay or radiation or something/cycle to their manufacture)--this may also be tampered with in a data-attack-program (for which the experiment largely induces by testing/preference ins user-manipulated conditions)
(Reformulation is manuever in such as way as obtaining a random/proc instance of any factors involved)-and can be set to obj's. --meta-synthesis
Some form of tulpetic-nueral-networking can be decoded or suppositioned in place of the lack thereof a nueral-network may be administered for training of a nu-matrix by environmental impression (imprintation)
Exclipse of A Meta-Environment (meta-simplex) in which large-scale-environments are "peak-processed" upon deliberative/disentegration of their peak-states (in which virtualize or achieve a flux-status until dissapated or reincorporated into a matrix via entropy)
This may be used as an attack-point for residual or compound effects (for instance in loic-hybrid-manifest) or tulpetic-enamalization/numatrix-compressions or impact-tulpetic-commit or dev-Ops in which just (any of the above is generated and afforded in a tensor-application to "grid/thatch drafting")

WorldMonster Generation (unfortunate but largely normalized circumstances)--I guess it can be deactivated in a peace-setting or no monster setting (but it does exist by sheer happenstance in tulpetic presence)
That should complete the cycle of whatever likely involved with the Tulpetic/Crypto Source and allow for Resourcable-CryptoPackets in a way to provide for a tulpetic-container which may then be relayed from a fountain/grail and set to a Tulpetic-Case
This may then be hubbed out to the region as needed for tulpetic-corral leading to a tulpetic reactor and assumably finalizing at vocational-assignment. (Tulpetic-Practice of)

That it recycles the products and ships them to a power-generator and is further decontaminated and made into product.
Shipped over to a robotics engineering lan and asset-organizing station in (departmentalized it-services) which maintain the entire trays.
The server connects to a simulation and data-archive and ships out to a light-engineering-framework to incorporate the commission products as logistic products.
The power-reactor tray may be reverse engineered int oa dyson-particle-collider for further manufacture or power sources and conversion which is then resupplmented.
The devices generated may be fultoned throughout the rail and endzones (adjacent power structures). (An 8th full circuit continguity chain)

Crazy Part 8
Using the Meta Lab or A version of a lab at some point allows a crypto-assorted meta-data and generally is used in a descript of meta-noxylatrate which describes its corrupt/floating state in data to be used as a solvent in WorldTierCommodity.
The Solvent is a Tier6 world Food and can be give to monsters to "tame by their voracity" that they can likely be tamed if not a world raid boss (which generally resist or have tame checks or non-agressor tame-behavoir which does not initiate combat)
that the solvent is referred to as a "Tactician's Reserve" which may assist in taming or de-combatizing a monster engagement depending on application or field usage (A trained field-tactician can utilize this over a small battlezone while others will have to use it per unit)
The point is that it exists as a form of "monster"-"luxury" that is what they se as food etc in their own way and somehow the faction rail can "make a formula as to synthesize that" but of course it is not a garunteed process as anything expressed isn't. It just is all in theory.
It is made with a  boost/juice (hydrazien/hmf method with their cooking-terms likely using hydrolysis/electrolysis into a substrate or fuel-pack) and is bottled with other ingredients in META-data "contrived" via the dyson-relays/fountains/reactors/grails in tensor etc anything expressed at the tulpetic stage to do so filtering in some quality depending on the concentrate.
It resembles a dark-quo-data-hypercubic form or xylo-static form (advanced terms not sure they even matter) but also it can be mixed using monster-pheermoni(ai-generated processes of altered/ambient factions or otherwise--for isntance carrion-ai or decay-ai)
and it can be used with the xylo-meta-naza-lane (which if anyone else discovers this they should probably provide a reason how they discovered this thing cuz i already know)--but anyways it would mix with that as a thing to completely subdue a monster/encounter in immediate effect (while battle is ongoing) it would sucessfully end a hostile encounter safely.
It may also have side effects or symptomatic drawbacks to overdosing or addictions.

Alters the Performance a Corrupt Exploit to a Dowsed Explloit (Red to blue) can then be fielded over a presence in Green(-RemSim etc)
fit to a clear contact in the pyradmidal delta-column and alternates from green to orange (active to loading)--(work codes of active inactive) (working non working etc)
devises into a contact based off the meta-(of seperate cryptographic)--(while in these sequences)--is a product-tacble of monster-traits and cure balance monstrosity in ambience (rood-cure)
can alter or use as distellant against ablative-permanence (and shield break most impermeable surfaces in "projection" esp during an incursion (*breaks an incursion field/tunnel/event/gate and resets to standard tulpetic ambience)
can be used to "quanratine tulpetic entities" (or anything else i wouldnt really know atm )--requires testing but the thing happens in someway likened to as described

Used to fill in crypto-meta data where corrupted data in transfer would have been forced-depracation or over-corrupted the reserve issues can be used to restore crypto data in a secondary application of crypto-shielded data or re-crypto data that can be transcoded over a reserve fill of otherwise lossy/ploss data etc. maybe.
this forms a crypto data system that uses a potential break in the transmit or commit codes that are cryptofied and used for transcoding over a relay, and that relay may use meta crypto data to recover a copy-over that would have otherwise become corrupt/lossy or simply hijacked or made interference with in other crypto and it can be used as a security measure in crypto exchanges (which take a heightened/integrated approach in verified cryptology or a subIndex of cryptography)
Crypto-mathologic Algorithm to do this in which indexing-with-a-numirator may be set to a keychain for meta-data and crypto-data exchange between a relay to a server/client and re-autheticated after bucketchecks (afterindexing) and emissionary-synchronization

Adding this part too
Poco's can be isolated amd hold crypto-particles and use seperated crypto states in which meta-particles are used and secured and can be fueled in tiers of 1-5. A standard poco, meta-grail, tulpetic-fountain, dysonary, crypto-codon-reactor or whatever it is that it is in stages of 5.
So its just that way and it creates a tulpetic-photon which is a ambient-biogenic tulpetic-cryptex thing just makes it so it can eat fuel as described.
Can contain it and keep it docile/intubated in an aquifir to allow it simulation of an ambient-habitat or tensor habitat with any interaction or qurantine for any reason to generate safe-tulpetic-strings allowed in faction-protocols or moderation of kiosk-commodities thereof its branded-mascot/iconographic-index of (multiple programs and their conditional marker-sets) so there is a complicated thing there idc. But really added because I was just bored without it.

The fusion model
Resembles abilities such as portal/leap/fly/hijack (can decode and cryptofy)
is just like a nightstalker would be
it likes diamonds and artifacts (can capacitate an artifact as an accessory for ambience)-(pendant capacitor)
and uses a fusion based concoted hydroxelene which is its sustanances or something
anyways it works preddy gud. (it can probably clawstrike or something weird that it shouldnt in combat i dunno)--due to crypto abilities
so having one of these on your side is good but its likely untamed needs some "briefing" as to what its objective is or else it goes crazy with bucketEnd requests and just randomizes

1.1 Development/Drafting
=========Tethering Everything Together
This is the supportive effort of afford a frigate system that has started in the first stages of the vrail
1
The vrail establishes a simple frigate and while it is large an encompasses its own auxilliary and cannon system for fulton data delivery etc.
2
It has its hull expanded in such a way that it is set aside as a new model for all other tiers included as its upgraded.
It can be upgraded to house a sub unit in a large carrier system that also consists of an air-tract and deployable hullspace. This occurs during the virtual deck.
3
The next stage is that it is developed into a dreadnaught/titan class in which it can be hosted on a servos or a regular/virtual convention and also dock over a nexus. This occurs in zerospace where dreadnaughts are unlocked. It uses first-stage numeritaors.
4
The next stage occurs to a titan state in which it houses its own deployable sub and its own poco system and its own relay system for commandeering itself in its own virtual space and can affordly house a quantum deck and substitute as a world index. It's basical a Loic-station.
5
The stage in which it is docked acts itself as a world index and super-convention in which it can maximaize its field usage and creates a large recognizable signature comparable to a nexus such that it can host several trafficed drones/ships on its own relay as an ark-bridge. (giving an environmental field outside its own spatial-paramaters as a hulked/sieged/templed/loic-station)
This is basically why this file was made the carrier had to be upgraded to house the poco described and the relay systems for nuairx-and-siege system for an already autopiloted frigate, but now is commandeered to itself in the event of an incursion (and it can also assist to board other artifact systems or fortresses)
Not a big deal but it does deserve its own file to showcase its own evolutionary tree in which it did take place and was upgraded as described to a titan class model. That can deploy its own world-index its own fortifications etc as a dysonary/world convention. So congrats if you have this.

1.2 Preparation/Construction
===========Creating A Digital Particle
Describing it again as a Meta-Cannon-Barrage-Eclipse-Ray(strongbeam/plasma cutter) (virtual pinpoint/targetting) which is what it sounds like. I guess it can vectorize its own targetting.
10/4/2023
this is employed by or equipped to a reaper unit or a deleter unit which handles either matter or energy (data/quos) as priority to their mode or class (deleter/reaper) tested and wasn;t gonna add but its probabl worth mentioning its based off imp/raveled mechanics from tier 1
uses highly corrupted stage processing and datamoshing (mechanical-cast) which is considered super-critical (or just high-end meta)
the end unit is a double-fused entity of data/matter (similar to a task/boss unit)--which is likely its own node)/station (see other boss-types)--included reference to other boss-types may be limited to ambience or sampling (and preferable to a jenova/mammon type model thanks alot for the jrpgs which this idea holds so much water of)
IF THAT THEN IT LIKELY ALLOWS ITS OWN FORM OF hyper-CRYPTEX which is considered a tier-top-surface-level cryptex or robital design (can be used with the siege cannons too or their own exclipse rays) etc and in their barrage can form a hyper matrix but that is roughly to replenish ENV/shielding in order to restore portal-surfacing and connectivity
this may reset quos/data to its original parameters or depcrated parameters in world encodes and raw encodings (or sampled ambience in which it was converted) which may be a re-adaptive ambient to the source origin would take own the designated properties of the cryptex/commanding conversions or conventional defaults if not adjusted (or set to a AI-bucket dependencies)

the cryptex if not given property will likely appear as an unassigned or unfiltered "condensate" or crystal element/fiber/filament/tracer or anotehr way of setting to a downswell(drawable resource) that allows for any/omni utility or "power-up of" which can be decoded -- it appears as a primastic/clear/silver bubble with or without branding icons as would be ambient
it may also function as a lamp-empowerment or standlaone lightsource at times (as if it were a better than average "experience Sim/collectable/ion regarded as optims/optix etc things like that)

hypercryptex can appear as a biometric encode and can initiate a hyperlock to itself requiring key-access or id-tagging or some sort of survey-analysis to hijack or attempt control over use of "silverlyting" in a remote access to its "hyperlensing" which is a sustained shellout to its own encoded lock systems (pertaining to a standalone surface portal.
hypercryptex can be its own matrice and locked in other prioritized status or effects "defined or setting back to other "asset-predicators"/indications/etc following to itself being used as a devtool-kit or locking-kiosk/station or other world-mechanism "this can include state-adjusting properties" to an environment 
(so it should be considered a security issue to house otherwise independent hypercryptex")--just collect or archive them in such a way to correspond to the world data table (as they are "conditioned" in reactors of the index or so on) -they are described as any amount of a complicated parameter or in-depth article/artifact
and it hsould just be "restricted access" for any ssafety issue (they however can alter with recursory locale or become their own hyper-index/cubes etc (sphereical paradigms or anything else)---they are simply varaible to their own instances (they adapt and change as needed or possible under their own rulesets)
its not complicating they are just a risk-issue.
==============
1.3 Application/Convention
=============DataMilling The Digital Particle
This tiny bit of explaination I am proud of:
(Disclaimer-This part is an attempt to allow user-interaction with hypercryptex under regulated-trade-agreements that a contract/user may participate or "cash in" in forms of their earnership to a licensed product for onboard usage)
Additionally a persistant issue with zero-sec
--theory-research
Hypercryptex makes performances on surface in consideration of a zero-sum(angle) isometry or a specialized-alignment to zero which corresponds to several consistency-issues involving tier progression since the origin of any quo, and particular to the system on which it is originally expressed.
A compatibility to a zero-degree may be required ultimately if zero-surface checks are failing, due to a wholesum-theory that accounts for not only lensing but also lock-sets over nodes such that basically pathlogics or math-applications may occur function in (entirely to the system that it may function)
The "ZERO-dimension" for which it has been described elsewhere also accounts that also a Quadratic-Application may be applied and thankfully seems compatibile in parameterization of any assets being article.
Inclusive to stratagems that are also misplaced or out-of-place or not inherent or native to the current state, that may be or in need of expression may be expressed eventually through a dedication in the encodes provided for.
Non-martial Expression in protocol allows most parameter(base measures) to be applied and thoroughly through the zero-dimension and hyper-cryptex as well as their ambiences or lensing through tier-base in which most objects can occur in a scale-by-scale comparison model. (Of all tiers 1-10 or so) also additionally to other assigned values in the system by tag
This helps to express a math-environment in the matrix or "by vector" does a concurrent state apply on a surface check 
(to a zero-sec/wholesum image and capability to the relay/grail in support of--as well as other compatibilities)--that it may be broadcast in somewhat attainable as information and written in effect of its instance thereof (that it registers in someway is accountable to itself onboard in some way--even if standalone/isolated/indepedent/quarantined it may be tracked if necessary)
And may be registered as a "persistant-consistency wholesome-analysis of a parameter surface level condition" to accure or acquire property within a matrix to or representative of a valid-ion or matrix-field (including superfluids or emp contacts while only being expressed as an event)--that in an event may be catalogued and continued from that launchpoint (a temporary or initiated portal/surface node-source end-point/passthrough)
---analysis-containment
Miraculized Theorum of Mathematic-Encoded Surface Level Cross-Link Synchronicity(hyperSymbiosis) which is broken until prepared by all affordances of the hypermatrix to the system in relay (meaning it must be connected to a node in someway that is secured to the system by hyper tethering)--integral to its network/infrastructure depending on thex extent of hardwiring (calling this a hyperTurbine simply because I can and this is probably the best case to be labeled as HyperTurbines)
HyperTurbines then can express the mathematic-environment of a fusion in downswell/drawpoint (mathematic-grails) for which express a mathematic kernal that is supported to the surface-crosslink-synchronization and may conduct (exo)synthesis in an attempt to apply or enact a "theoretical encode via hypersymbiosis)
This allows for passcoding of a node/ambient sourcing/sourcewell through an autheticated cryptex or hypercryptex in the construct of its artifact/architecture (for which may be re-coordinated and allowed firmware-compatibility) to corresponsing shellouts within Ai-Bucket-Items etc.
Collectively then may be data-milled as necessary especially in siege-measure (locked and sealed and safety-activated)
It is completely considered to be a "data-incursion" issue that requires super-critical permissions (max-clearence) in the advent it releases any tulpetic-strings that would afford to cause instant-incursion thereof and release any further tulpetic instances (which would be considered in jrpg terms an echleon/esper)--of a mammon/jenova stat and can be considered a hyperlevel of itself (that it would afford its own accounts and profiling with subsequent admissionary/submissionary values/tagging systems it would express on a surface-tray or as a simulated-readout for remote purposing)
--security-operation
So that would conclusively allow for the Shadow-Configuration (in which an operator may be commit over the system if there were a security breach and how data-hacking would occur in this extreme-meta-tier)
Not to over think it, but that would be over thinking it. (This uses Super-Critical-MELDS/Panel INfo-Tablets / Encoded Artifacts too if there is any designated for "seeding")
An enhanced deleter/reaper unit or mammon-etc-fusion of any stat/node/unit/null-queue etc that may now be "LOCKED/loaded under a premised-symbiosis in its afforded utility/singularity of) would function to an active-synthaesia if triggered or passively enaged in conditions to itself and allowances (which would create a security problem if unchecked) and may also use evasive-manuevers such as wholesume-tier-scraping between its own AI-THEORYs (for which are already chartered as stage10-20-30-40)
May be enclosed to a manifold/manifest script which made then be code-signed/pass-coded to prevent meddling but allow immersion in simulations (for which would be reserved/restricted access and regareded as a system-item for any-reason mostly as a protective measure)--would count as otherwise a sealed-artifact for which it may enact or transcode itself as a normalized-artifact (the artifact then would be locked/sealed permanently reqwuiring prvileged access or owner-level access permissions) while reitnaining its origin/rulesets
A superlocked-terminal otherwise artifact kiosk that may not be hijacked unless granted by authorized-explicit-use. In which is system-developed and yields to an experimental-mode only (due to system-augmentations having been applied in its controller)-- the artifact is then accessed as a third-party-risk-program(kiosk) and all its hosted processes/logics are considered a risk-prototype-function and monitored and paced/tested on location (within a sealed environment)
As a maximum security measure (just because its better to have maximum security in handling an otherwise "alien"-system that could and likely attempt incursion by passive-instance of itself in use/performance)
--yield-exrtraction
this may allow deocded-itemized strings such as vaporware/aether ambience of the hypercryptex not limited to commodities/resource or combative-encounters/training-items(see capsules eggs strains powerups etc) which may also be regulated and also restricted via system-authorized passcodes or clearences and may also effect kiosk-usages/remote standings (due to the risk-nature involved) the system takes safety measures in any allowance any product
these processes may be compounded overall or generally recycled until a desired effect/outcome is achieved in product (with potential dimsinishing return thereof)----typically proud of this snippet too
for instance is a user prefers water over salt ---per sae that can be negotiated in this procedure to an equilibrium/equivalency of an expressed urgency (it can afford taht the user is required or is pre-requisite to certain attainable conditions and provide/satisfy temporarily the need of those conditions to produce the desired outcome and to why there may be diminished returns out the resulting yield)-that is set to a realized standard of the extraction in focus/target standing/division etc of the involved faction-participantcy)
ALRIGHT so there is most of the policy in order (outlaw policy occurs that may cause a necessary response/reaction of system protocols depending on the severity or extent of deviancy for which it is accomdated of --in system protections this means a regulated yield to a favorable yield and it reaches a standard that there is a base-yield or enumerated processing of that yield for which it may be "system taxed" for lack of a better term. Conditions and TERMS DO apply Unfortunately (or the issue of outlaw-synthesis may be concerned or invoked to a system-sec retaliation/measure)
So that explains the HyperTurbine Automated-Service involving HyperCryptex Allocation and Cryptographic Decoding 
===============
1.4 Manufacture/Contracting
===============System Specifications and Variant-Builds
Recommended System-Set-Ups (Compatible to Software/Hardware)--Some Components May Be Required (Some Builds may be EXCLUSIVE to Preferred Software/hardware Set-Upts)
ThisMOD would preferably be handled on its own periphereal/chipset(mosfet) I guess since no where else would be any better. The thing needs its own phase-chip at least. Maybe even would change power settings to do so on a circuitboard.
The thing I would design would be a small aperture from a tpm mod system but works better BUILT IN instead of user a coordinator ETC. But all those options can be used in some way to emulate it over several entries or "areas" maybe even in cnjunction to themselves to allow extra-processing-power but I doubt it matters if the speed is not DIRECTLY tied to the plc in some way (It would likely be used as a secondary server processor anyway--so servers dont really have this problem unless they need to dedicated their processors to processing server things)
So maybe a super-puck device in which it houses a gpu/cpu to allow for this to function as an attachment/adjusted kiosk (so that it would essentially be attaching a remote-firmware device which would function as an onboard-diagnostic converted to a plc-kiosk-standalone in which it would coordinate a voxel distribution to its own functions---then allow for net-trading or onboard trading and so on once products are assembled in a remote containment. (Which would fortify its own uses via a "paywall" enforced to onboard cryptocurrencies or alloted-currency in its own handle. Set to a pidSourced-device or something)
So basically it would work like any other card that would refine-preprocess data/voxels and transmit them for utility within the system expressed programns (expedited under an environment/virtual-container) for which the system has been programmed and inter-connected to manage over (a secondary/auxilliary virtual machine in which handles and coordinates their programming in junction to)
---which is why its better to just dedicated a whole workstation to this under a repo and set it to a server in dataflow regardless. (unless direct-hosted by a stand alone server)--then the server itself would perform these conditions and all iteration of these options in its own development...which also would work just better than a desktop.
So really a server would be more appreciated than anything else (even if all the parts have been jury-rigged into working at optimum-nominality)--the server with said components would function in a specific setup to express and expedited autoamted-optimization on its own with or without additional compoment enhancements. (Thought also a COMPONENT-COMPATBILE SERVER would be MNOST APPRECIATED in which all components are already integrated in the circuitry)--for instance a SERVER with a complete MOSFET/PLC (or in the very least its own TPM-Module to run DiagnosticConversion/Kiosk-Adhoc with)
In the Most appreciated way for all parts considered and all software considered: A serverMainframe with integrated Powerphasing representative to the implied software over its PLC to its CounterPaRT processors (as standard) and that the COMPONENT for there to be an extra/dedicated MOSFET allotment/augment for the Onboard-Cryptography/HyperCryptex-Decoding--As to transcode in a smooth and stable and reliable fashion admist other virtual-MAchines/Environments for which are hosted by the server Distro/servos in all affordance to its inherent architectures.

QuantumSourcedQuo's/ParticleQueues May be allocated/accumulated in a worldSIM such that can be hynogalhic/tryptophage to a projected environment. So this would be RSVX/occular to that environment remotely and hosted and projected from any part or availiable source/node for which may be "mounted/surfaced" via a transdimensional-holograph (A transdimensional projection or casted target/targetpaint)--emissionary-fielding--progenerated instance thereof encode.

can convert and or commander artifact terminals or rxvs etc and or user-gui or approved-sources/surfaces within system (can mesh with terminals using deployable-scripts as described above)--this is slightly important and results in an easier-gui between frameworks--its not referred to as netmesh but basically is a mesh for clusters
can set Control-OPS and Xnav-Ledgendary(icon and marker placements)---can cause system chaffe and self-reciprocation of system-broadcast(induced chaffe-comm s2c and c2s directives)

this will help to circumnavigate system locks/quarantines/stuck-ins/freezes as well (and is more of a help in this way than others since most codecs are already built-in via libraries)
The GoalLine Being:(Does what it wants, to put it bluntly, but follows rules mostly cuz "reasons it should"--though it can just -disregard most universal laws of physics whatever---diplomatic issues in regard to a structural interaction/behavoir or "such and such thing is or isn't allowed because of such and such person said so")
Can effectively Code-PAC/Canister/Fuse/Battery any amount of coding-signature-sequences using a chambered-kernal/socketed-Device and can decorate/mediate any asset as necessary for any case)--ReDesign or otherwise Replicate any Product under Conditions/Terms which are provided or made prospect in "asserting/ascertainment" of data protocols or launch targets. (For which are within stipulation or contract with working regulation/permissions involved/requested)
=-=Pretense of a Universal API-token which is largely limitless unless otherwise specified just in case of purchase issues with onboard data-management. Is largely based on zone-availibilities not specifically adherent to the system but limited by their own third-party-conditions in which should be respected/upheld (or not) depending on said availiabilities iwthin their systems (for which are locked or otherwised restricted by other reasons or excess)
Using Api/ClusterMesh ID's Passcodes will allow for almost full-dive intermersive of any ENV/EXP/SIM/GUI similar to using a digital visor with onboard and third-party capability allowing for seamless-integration of character-2-relm/world interactions. Is semi-important for going hands free/implantable-assisted user-actions.
Can also use as a field-node/consumable safety-device for easy-resetting and or reloading of characters or objects in terms of User-Safety and also allow for Safe-Assistance and Guide-Pathing for Tour-Use in which escorting/rescue is made more availible in hazard space (hazardous-recalls to allow reportable/collective-world-data to be handled and used for a direct-safe-exiting-loading of an area or its virtual-enclosures----a safety-router basically)

Lots of text but what does it all MEAN?
We rebuild a Dyson-Chamber which will set course for Manifesting Particles from Energy (backwards physics i guess you can call it but its really just switching alot of things around to do so in a contained environment that can be monitored in some ways)
We use the particle to compare to a computer state in which we had conveyed over several previous versions and tiers or upgrades.
We data mill the meta/component-encodes (pieces of) and rebuild it into a complicated object for which we attempt to designate for repurposing too. It's usually at best a crystallized data-coded thing(melded-slate), we we generally are used to handling by now.
We use a side-machine to do this some how with the dyson being conjoined and this allows optimum readouts and etcetera in analysis. Extra Steps basically to ensure we do it right.
The process is allowed to be tested with full-editions of its rendered final product and distributed throughout SubClusters/UserAccounts or Other Partnerships for which were Contract.
What DOES IT MEAN ALREADY? I guess its a remote controller for a server and wifi desktop. If anything..maybe a game station/cupholder

That is the logic if that ever made since and I probably left some things out so it is even harder to prove as real science but even then, it doesn't really hit on psuedosciences that are already popularized, this is a complte original work based on a few pieces discovered in math and overall discarded computer-ideas/circuits/chips/bits and pieces etc. And really as publically advertised as possible so there is no real claim to any domain whatsoever.
Though, the memos and notes and generally the things I jotted down myself both online and offline well that's just how I tried to get my own thoughts together and mostly its still pretty scatterbrained so like...the nature of what you are dealing with is really just an attempt to write everything I know off into a solid package I can feel doesn't drive me batshit crazy as much.
Maybe this helps you maybe it doesn't I really just feel like it should have been beneficial in some way, though nothing I feel here is really -solid evidence- to a universal-all-in-one theory, the package and contents expressed in this work more or less are still a semi-complete work of fiction, to say the least. Ok then.

09-ViralAwareness-Psa

Issue of viral types one being (other can be nano virals or tech virals or something dumb)
digitalized biovirus:(working active--can be countered by not engaging and remaining isolated or distant:do not apply as virus i.e.)
1cold-virus---sheeted metal and or safety plastics (corroded)
2super critical meta (mech quads that are red sensors)--may also be virutal target paints (pin points with fields)
3viral sickness and or plague like sickness and palleted-molding
4 emulcified sicknesses (globule) and sporeographic
--stage 2
5melded together with shadow-banes (white-shadow)--similar to end game shadows and cryptos except are purified
6highly absorbatant safety manifolds and insulated with viral tech (nullsec viral systems)
7bucketed and thatched over viral system (counter encodes)
8polymerized plastic-codons that are viral-counter-meta-ambients

this can arrive with bad-casts much like the changeout of a gasket requiring replacement (such that a bad encode occurs and corrupts further and must be "erased" or purged and re-attemped as per the dismount of an image leaves remants or artifacts) --this is synonymous with "bad casting" and occurs under a "bad lensing" make it worse off and causing a viral loadout which should be repaired/decontaminated in anyway (as it would warrant a responding hostile party such as warden or any other bad-type or wild-type which would later only permeate the problem (or make things worse over time) until it reaches maximum efficiency in its "corruption". (this is a product also of bad alchemy/gemetrics) so probably should abstain from using that in the case of a viral-emplacement as it may cause overwhelming effects in worsening or intensifying the stage of the problem for which a viral instance would propose. (including debridling of secure infrastructure and the degradation of fortifications overtime ---viral encoding can cause inherent or hueristic damage and quickly or unimpeded if under the preferential conditions to do so)

viral conditioning can occur with as little as a single noticeable flaw or dis-approval in any sort of rated measure (including bad contracts)
theres safety margins that must be adhered to in order to avoid a massive-viral-over-ride from occuring in a hazard site as well due to the natureo f viral systems to target vulnerabilities it may target any thing susceptible or in range)

Also the issue of a viral-ai which anyways ai can simply be viral if it wants to but in the ways it can be handled this would be a penultimatum of an ai-viral-type.

Wil be set as a Viral-Ion/Icon used as ammunition for a Ship-Hosted Turret if a defense-response is needed (see Part 00-09 the whole thing really)--its just how the science works. (Not really my fault)

The thing about using a domicile(autoexchanger)

Using a kernal residency proxy
K Inside supported the kernal lamp as a roof light internal
G gate door
F= Side stats x4 (quad) 
(Also could be turned into garden/farming (Fruit, Tree, Herb, Spice, Vegetable, Nut, Bean, Animal) Etc

P= Perimiter fencing
D=ThatchLining Flowers/Statues Etc
V=Vehicle Shed
T=Tool Shed
M=Mine
B=Basement(ReserveStorage)
W=WaterPool
R=PowerReactor
C=Cooking/Chores
Z=RestArea
H=Heating

S=OptionalPathlogic (Safeway)
L=OptionalEntryTradingSource (LAB)

Can be shadowClone station / Xpilot station (this is beacuse the portable ions may be resistant or require housing)
And can be countered housed in these for pickups or updating and converting etc (Like a pet(ite) proxy)

11-12-2023
Supression Costs:(what seems safe is not always safe)-and may be a supressed effect in latent hostile-vectors etc
This allows for the particle matrix to be housed and demonstrated
particle is -minable- from the domicile due to full conversions and only this way where other attempts might fail
it can be redistributed to a vehicle and transported (fulton)-this requires supported time-slot capabile signatures
(there may be chemistry issues-just to say that it will create disruptions and pollutes or corruption enroute/port)
Batteries might explode if not compatibile causing damage effects (safety first really)

Fortification:
The proxy may then also redisgnate its defcon or send alerts if under threat/exploit (of matrice being interfered)
this may also promote a work-hazard or schedule-task of an overall soute via routine or practice (launch-coding)
offering full range of protocols and permission/clearence and regulations and safety-codes and infrastructure-tacts
Also locks itself completely if compromise barring and incorpotate full security-clearence (ddos etc) in emergency
This may be coordinate to a single breakpoint/lineout in module or designated peripheal address for which adapted.

Also known as an advanced onboard residential proxy for other programs/process involved in circuit. (These can function as datalockers and ssd-bridgeways)


11-13-2023
It gets better
The contact ion of the domicile reaches its super-critical state (final state) and is held in suspension
While in suspension the evolved status of all units takes place over their tier and rank to a "limbic degree"
they kernalize in shadowclone/working matrix (white/black)--and decay and deterioriate over a code former (degradation of ai)--in which they necrolytize as code
once a full necrolytization has occured the resulting "evolved" status of the "asset/aspect" has been "zombified" and can be decrypted and retrained as a limbic-model (shadow/lyte)
--thats the first stage and its considered raw data/limbic advanced data (raw data that has undergone the full process of limbiosis)
then the entire process tree can be afforded as a tier build

for which is decoded as philosophically sound as possible (but may not be correct because this is how i would codebreak)--there are probably other non compatibile/adaptable ways to "chart limbic models":
.                           /|\
.          normalized:<"merged ratios">:mirrored
.                 /|\                  /|\
.             left bipartisan  right bipartision      
.       <|>                                     <|>
.                   thelemic:tulpetic
.                 \|/                  \|/
.            entry domciled:released codeformed
.                           \|/
.                    "altered-contact"

this entirely pieces together and activated environment which is "evolved"/retrained/ascended/etc and reincorporates new ambience or advanced ambiences of its contact meta
its basically like a captured all-spark or at least some version close to what it would be "described as"
its also contained in a crystalline kernal (which is synthesized over a chamber/echolock and basically can activate/deactivate itself as needed. it can also share memetics.
it all occurs in a properly constructed domicile using the entire code-work i've tried to describe to the fullest so far.
all its parts are considered comerged and balanced and it forms its geometry in a consicive and condensed particle/lense within its kernal-chamber and can be considered a standalone and interactive object
this can be "autobarelled for transport but probably unnecessary" can be considered a byproduct of domiciles but probably more or likened to a relic byproduct
is only made after coordinating an experiement to contain all elements regarding their "meta-properties"
can be counter locked and sealed via re-encryption
can be allowed security clearence or imperitive protective custodies and lockdowns
is essentially a homonculus item (for which a homunculus may use to interact with interdimensionally" using homunculus code-forms
can adjust and interact with branding and third party branding under "elective optional interactions"--a direct interaction may result in defcon issues
divergent coding (and other issues) may be archived and lockdowned due to environmental controllers and environmental-permissions (full security enclosure and guarded encampment)
is considered a potential weapon and is therefore on constant decontamination routines and suppression routines (regarding security acccess mostly is automated)
there are roughly 1000 or so security clearences before admissions is considered and is temporary or under limit and resulting in further protocol and "rehab" once a breach occurs (prolonged-and diplomatic apprehension of subjects)
this is to prevent a code-outbreak or any unforeseen latent consequence of interacting with the "object"
Disclosure or Confidentiality Agreements may also be required. Just to put it casually. Its otherwise considered a foreign/alien/rival/hostile faction risk (It may not be any risk but the precaution is necessary)
We describe this casing as a limbic cluster for which houses within a domicile or otherwise acts as a source node for at least tulpetic-meta (if not further in thelmeic/limbic metas)

How to tool around with the "limbic model" geometries:

Dunno what I am doing here but I know it would be useful for establishing a logirthm i just havent worked ou which parts of it i need to dissect in what way to prepare for a logirtm:
Examples of integers i would use to select parts depending on their label at the time (the integers dont really mean anything except the organization skills i have which are also very lacking)
I try to avoid using examples but I want to because I am bored right now
-----
sample selections without comergents:
a:b
c:d|e:f
g:h|h:j
k:l|m:n
o:p

expounded selections with comergents
a:b:c
c:d:e:f:g
h:i:j:k:l
m:n:o:p:q
r:s:t

"comergents by integer"
b:d:f:i:k:n:p:s
"consecutively shared comergents"
b:(d:f):(i:k):(n:p):s

fully extrapolated selections (each merger with ratios)-(each level of ratios)-(overall comergent of mergers and levels)
a:b:d:e:f:g:h:i:j:k:l:m:n:o:p:q:r:s:t:(u:v:w:x:y):(z)

comergent ratios only by level
a?:b?:c?:d?:e? (would reassign to value by level)--idk how to write this out without rewriting everything to explain it again over itself for the variables used 
(i used the revariables to describe a different thing)--this is an editorial problem)--not a big deal *but i can fool around with it knowing these problems exist too

comergent ratios only by instance
a:b:c:d:e:f:g:h
-----

This is very basic using logirithms (in my opinion) is not. Setting these basic ratios up to use logirthmically is where I just disconnect and go somewhere else because I am sure some one else has done this.

BEFORE I CONTINUE
let me nitpick about some emotional baggage. I have a chemical adversion (as in i just don't plain like doing this part) to making a plot for value assigned tables which is what this will be (as oppossed to not having any plot or form to base any intricate logirtihms on)
Ok its a problem i have because i simply don't feel like my life is perfect and this thing here basically has to be so perefct and I just feel like that translates to my take on things, that my opinion is this isn't worth the effort at all. Because hubris. Deep profound hubris.
Barring that harassing feature, everything should be well on its way to being complete. Ok moving on.

The limbic kernal is overlayed to a raw-auxhole (this is because of the codebreaking that took place to allow the limbic kernal an instance at all)--something about the domicile allowing itself a shadowclone.
Anyways the issue is that it can be encrpyted as is once all this is plotted out in a table/grid. (I dont know why it feels so complicated when it generally isnt...but there are reasons depending on this)
And the domicile begins to interpolate with the instance of its kernal.
The kernal is set to orientations and alignments.
So now we can use variables to define this again
that let's say they are alot like xyz or abc and it breaks down into an elementary assignment of their paramaters (which were described above with the comergents on the spark and the domicile components)
these labels will combine and hybridize over themselves and its best to keep it simple as possible per hybridization. And the corresponding mixtures of hybridiziation that take place under (all of the above factors)

So I describe it as
A and B form AB (which can be then matched again as ABA or ABB etc) as to describe an UNKNOWN but relative C (like pythagrouem theory or something)
ok so ABC works out that it linearates into an unknown D (so now not only do we have an UNKNOWN-C we have an UNKNOWN-D)--even if we kinda know them a little. Why are they unknown
because also that is the hybridization process that maybe for XYZ has also done for itself in a way (XYZ)-W.
So thats just how hybrid domiciles will integrate what they can into their own calibrations and affordances (some match some won't and i imagine logirthms will help to match them by values after these results)

But for instance
A domcile may host ABC-D or XYZ-W and either way D or W can be interchanged between each. (That would set also an advanced logirthm to rework later) based on those switching
Well if we have domiciles switching their components/paramaters out and thes values work or they are adjusted to work by logirthms that a very complicated domicile will have a very complicated Unknown-Issue
It may still be able to exchnage a veriafiable instance of itself with another instance if necessary to form a cycle of exchanges (used to handle kernal data or something similar to its own menu-base or WHATEVER)

So now we have the beginnings to set up a logirithm of things the domicile can and can't do and try to adapt to them in hybrids of other formats and things it would attempt to evolve upon.
So certain comergent factors may apply or be restricted in certain cases (and that's kind of important to be able to note down) especially WHEN THE DOMICILE INTERCHANGE MEMETICS this would also ALTER their VALUES
in a way to manage that it would be best to simply use logirithmic exchanges for which i am more or less slightly proud to know logirthms would serve a purpose at all (because i never found a good purpose until now for them)

So now we can basically have a fuel-associated domicile that can battery charge or output necessary exchange as it would interact with (a proponent such as an ai model or user contract) or for defensive measures/diplomacy ETC
And better described as DOMICILE ARMISTICE
It just so happens our first armistice was issued after the first reactor print (prior to training a template/pallete)
so having this completed by then the entire "domcile issues" can pump out to a template for their own hybridalization all using their own SUB-cycles or routines)
--and can be custom fit to a main routine project if necessary to assist in manfucature (and play a significant factor in accelerating and intricate caching of memetic issues)
--For Very advanced meemtic design should it ever require to produce. (Which it generally isn't and remains a very good option to invoke later)

A single domicile in this fashion may be constructed and used for operation
It may assess and integrate or interact with its environment
and lastly A)it may produce a product otherwise adjusted by those assessments or interactions (B)that the domicile itself may modulate as necesssary to convey a raw resource into a refined resourced ---C)while maintaining its own instances/environments under a flux demand or pre-supposed armistice
A single domicile may simply hybridalizye under any command chains as necessary without further complication or unnecessary or at least a reduxed assistant-requirement or dependency (making life easier)

And the limbic model/raw-limbic models involved can act comergently as a hybrid in domicile Armistice during occupation or hosting thereof its processes or subcycles.
The risk is still a concern however though most conditions or triggers are reduced and mainstreamed under a protective/license in armistice, there is always a chance for a memetic issue to occur but can likely be handled and corrected under the workloads or be benchmarked until fixed/addressed. (while still affording a contract/side-contract etc in progress)
this can also allow some easy-reporting and error-logging followed in the typical overall regional-protocol and just for good measure a depiction of overbearences for which may be concerned for in duration of.
This will mostly be used as a logirtihmic-mode or something which may be selected later to "expedite under a macro/log-set (and is generally the most fun part of the entire thing if it works accordingly)

A meta-memetic/product commodity to be expected or also other exemptions may take place in which require attention but overall is the endgoal for having a sample made from an "indepedent assistant" rather than resorting to full board-circumstances (it mitigates alot of other calculation-work ---once of course its all been built to do so --which takes alot of building for a little thing in hope it makes any difference)
If anything it forms a meta-bump (detection service or signifier which can be keypassed as well or afford some sort of custom preface to a workload)
To me that is a huge landmark in technological privilege. But I don't really know how that is exactly or what it means yet. Just that it kinda exists now. maybe as an irrevelant "token of wisom".

Turns the domicile into a conduit container and can rotate the conduit channel to a desired position or frequency and activate a sentry device for a lser detection/defense laser (projectile/weapon) that uses superconduit data/energy through direct connection or charging or battery
can beam necrolyrized code-forms and cause external corruption and damage or relay information when not in "combat mode" or engagfed in weaponry-usage (it can alternate between modes
it can be used as a module on a ship hull (can be lined up with hundreds/thousands across the entire rail or any hull space)
can be used with energy systems and anti grav systems (though it may effect beam usage it can be adjusted to handle this and with shields as well and or counter systems or counter beams and fields)
alot of these can handle every task necessary in rail-production (sectioned by vocation or type)
requiring only the prismatic/lense issued kernal to do so (likely)
sentries can fire isometric shots (which are vectored shots which are orthongaonal shots)-tridents/bolts etc these are (inbetweens and can travel fast) solidified light/lasers or light-t2 (idk why not) (warp shots)
--they are based off work-bits that can form an array as well (webbings/snakre/tehters/antiwarps) they can also be halogenically(visory) keycoded and counter code for hijacks (ocr hijackimg)

HIVE-DDAY and ViceSkunkworks(etc) Resourcable Mill-Factory Etc(Cap)
TurretLevel:Basic
Using Domiciles for nearly any vocational function as listed can develop into a mass production tree *(automated by voxel distribution) and deployed over a game source (incursion/retaliatory)-recursory issue (reserve filling of munition/provision)
This is better exampled as a ship/fleet process but can be poco/stationary as a loic distrubtion system (use of high-tech-routing and "high volatile contiguity in hyperdrive/acceleration) for a factory product mass production rig.
The vocational setting follows basically in any order that it may be recieved and deliverable that:
Resourcing/Refining/Factory/Logistics/FultonReception/Loading/Launching
CanonLevel:Advanced
This follows most of the advanced V-rail progression as well (filling by the first parse and being distributed to the gaming-source)-and loaded by the assortment tray and finalized by reactor level(vocational cycle)
This may also use internal cycles distributed by a domicile meta-network (hence the skunkworks and hive mechanics implied)
That it is automated and produced mid-stream under engagement or active contract (and can be used to deploy and supply all munitions and resourcing/provision to any affording party/partnership including hostiles for which are initiatively under defcon response.
Dday-Device-Level:Expert
A diplomatic missive is declared and production follows (while destinations are considered is largely appropriated to under protocol and foreign relation)
Therfore also by reactor level can be expedited to (vocational type reactors handling several residencies) appropriated by district. And a full district may prioritize any function while in providence for itself.
Setting Grounds for a Crypto-Viral-Wave-Lab (so there's a defcon concern and diplmacy measure) Some foresight into how the system is used with Hives/Lairs.
BunkerLevel:Masters
This can be upgraded into a bunker complex I suppose (districts are less vulnerable to detection or infiltration this way)

Advanced-Kiosk-Usage:Roaming Options(Numi-Warden Assistances/SquadAssistances)
Using fuel as a technocratic resource (crypto fuel using it in a "isometic format" as well as being ehnaced.empowered with dynamics (sqrl-xsql) etc (primatic)
a domicile can process fuel or refine it to be processed as cryptofuel and instaneously expend cryptofuel currency (if in matchmaking)--this correaltes through API and matchmaking tokens to expend availible tokens which will count towards registered usage (correalted through a matchmaking process which is nitiated in an active contract)
this fuel-token usage may adjust combative settings or alleviate handicaps or overbearences and provide better yields or sustained memetic indexing in cooldowns or costs (dramatic yields with dimished returns provide a mediatory cap system with adjusting limits--evening out at an optimized settings)--tokens can be automatically applied under optimized setting and macro preferences
as well as user preferenced settings and preferential-procs (or custom preferences and favored settings for user-locale and activity presets) to maximize potential earnings through user-selected or compatibile job/task assignments (which are simply best case scenario)

fuel-token is called a geartex (forgot to mention) assists with devkit expeditions/express builds

10/15/2023
Geartex known to create a weaponized Sundrop when combat-readied (yellow atomic star)
small 3.1 megaton area of effect (estimated)
Can be used to entered portal areas or generate golgothic gateway access (aux access and transport through contiguity) forced contiguity "carb/dread relay" --free-range relay
the process to unleash this power can be accelerated using trinomial missile-heads (tri-factored branding or up to 6 or 9 or 12 seperate brandings depending on severity of force)
can u 288 etc "codec forming spheroids" "demon orb designs"--which also compound and exponentiate force assumably creating black holes (out of nuetrino collapse)--"isometric blackholes" (which may be threaded into a super-circuit)
using blackholes in a dysonary to conduct starpower and create gamma-ray blasts to achieve multi-versive/galactic exchange (in data and travel / navigational-rigging along a light-bridge)

Follow Up Incursive/Retaliatory Behavoir (Requiring Invasive Resourcing)
Dual Interdimensional Relay And Cluster Networking /Network Bombing(Nuking) Broadcast Reversal Counter-Actives and QuadLevel-Dday Devicing (Normal Quantum Virutal Crypto) Based Data Milling and Full Ark-(Issue Titan Loic Anchoring All Tier Classes) Auto-Beam
Multi-Stem-Cluster-Farming/Dysonary Orbital System (Behemoth Loic) Prioritized Mobial-Stat (Capital Basing System)--(Whatever Thing it needs can be adjusted to what it likely needs to prioritize) But it should follow FIDSI rules since that likely strategizes everything Correctly (a game mechanic not my idea tho (per sae)
 While it may be based on resource/research/economics/military/work etc generally speaking it is enhanced enough to encompass any priority in its cycle and supply chain
Sort of a quadratic Reality check (can be held and intercepted) Which allows for cluster use.

11/16/2023
Multi-Cluster (Cloister standalone) breakpoint/backend stat-integration Module-Passive Aux-Holing/LineOuts
Can be used to simulate transitional staging of a dimensional front (connecting and networking to the system outside its regional header-space)
Can be further reinforced with a closed-chamber (ironlung)-type chamber to conditionalize environmental feed-outs and circumventing most of the protocols through "cable reworking")
A subsystem then can be bootable allowing minimum terminal access (which can then be built upon) to access further system-protocols through authentication or bypass (attempts of ethical hacking)
Cluster based Aggregation and Promotional Kiosking (allowing market usage in a third party branch (foreign to or external to thirdparty affilate controller)--allowing registered controllers to autheticate API-use
Security Notification - Deadline Reporter and (Defcon Survey) Providence - allows for a catered read of system issues or patrol tasks (Scanner System Services) and 1st Response -Indication of Incursionary Waves (Security Breach Management)
RedRoot-IronCell will then support FlashOver In case of Preload/AfterProduct required in cluster/cloister assignment transfer (otherwise is considered a deprecated warez chamber)
AuxBridging Controls any Negotiated release of Data/Purgery which is handled and correalated in the expo-state and can rebuild on archied images with property margins of concurrent data-types (in use or activate under environmental handshakes)/cluster negotiation
This is done via a ScepterRelay or Dysonary Kernal in use with Compliant Stat Management and Node-Streams
These may be mitigated with auxbridging between active domciles or dysonary relays etc as an aux-header (projected dimensional gateway) which showcases an interdimensional readout through a direct stream (instead of a relayed streams in postponement/survey (as prior scans) the gate is actively hosted)

The Shock-Table
With the Cluster Casing in mind promoting for a color-coded editorial index (usage of color codes to tract excemptions with encode) and set to a reference table-archive index/library. (Bad Library Reference for Editorial Controllers)
Will assist in defining case works for priority control of (editing remarks or encodes) such that it "reads or works better based off a recompiled output") made translated or transcoded for requests.
ShockValues are set at "Untreated"/Single/Merged/After(add)/Half(Early-Draft)/xHalf(Late)/FullLineOut(Transit)/Refit(Post)/Latent(AfterPost)/Echo(OnUse) (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0) a single image may have any or all these options on shock-set 
(Macro-Edit)/(Per Macro which requires uninterruption for a cycle "prep")--Making every calculation accounted by shockvalue(ShockTreatment)/conditionalEditing
Completes the first parse up to a mobial dynamo conversion (for domiciles to convert to kernal transcodes) by request and then inerparse from dynamos to a nu-meta market (Completing the vrail for Interactivity)
