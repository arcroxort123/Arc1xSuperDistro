Description
06--07THIS IS A FULL BOOTSTRAP BUILD FOR--07--08
works marginally either way (rollbaks or progressions)
Below are Described Versions of the Content-Table of the Whole system Provided under A Macro
The editions included are BASIC/Advanced/Expert Just because things required these degrees of seperations with the options permitted.
The differences of the model itself is the first edition Distro (with some added builds based off the progression of the Distro/Tokamac then with the NUAIRX/Dyson and later Tulpetic/Construct(domiciles) issues per Version)
SOMEHOW I managed to breeze through this complication more or less, so that's just less work FOR YOU! Well it could use a little more tied-together-ness but its MOSTLY just FINE! This will work out in coding later. 
(Kind of lucked out and just finangled everything in a nice step-up/step-down of what the system can be used for)

Also it works out that:
Legacy Contains a basic Model
Base Repo Contains an advanced Model
Full Distro Contains contains the expert model

=====
Basic Is just  Steps 1 through 20 (no added options or anything)
(nice and dry with almost no oversights...that I saw anyway lol)
=====

Pre-MiniProject(This is to build then use for mini-projects) (Combines Repo/Legacy with Ai-Theory)--Attempts to Load Distro as Projection (Further Distro to Extras + Brain) Yield as Copy over (Auto-Data-Management)
AKA Dysonary Loic System Use with Dyson-Interactive-ShellOut
Macro-Auto-Builder SystemTable(with Shocks) allowing Full Dysonary Simulation (Market-Launch) 
(Base-Relay-Projection-Clone)--(Full Dynamo/Mobial Simulation-Cluster with Network Convey)
Basically the DeathStar or WorldBuilder (take your pick I guess)

THE arc1x expanded-serverbuild as of 9/28/2023
Once I finish everything this will take over as the main project:
1
Build a server
Get components and extras for server build
2
Install Softwares and Programming for Server hosting
Virtualize Server for interactivity through hosted programming
3
Build a database
build a database compiler
Reassembly database and server codes by virtualizing hosted programming between with repositories
4
Build a live-serviceable network between virtualized server and database
use serviceable network remotely between clients using standalone programming
5
Host Shell programming System (interactive and virtual shell) with Original Finalized Compiled Services
Established NetMeshing between Server/Clients using Repositories
Also Use of Tokamac SuperTurbine and LocalizedHyperNetwork

Advanced
Used to Make Clusters from Distros-Base

--******--Disclaimer Dependencies That are not yet Installed:SKIP Until Prequisites are MET in Final Build
====Revistation after FINAL BUILD(meaning it must be developed):(You can try but you will NEED the Distro at least) or also AT LEAST THE AITHEORY INSTALLED 
(You don't need legacy if you have the rest)(Though LEGACY will also likely make it possible)--(YOU NEED CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS OF THE REPO/DISTRO or LEGACY/AITHEORY)
(It's BETTER to install REPO/DISTRO Firsthand before attempting this in any build)--THERE ARE MARGINAL ISSUES THAT OVERLAP OR OVERHANG between EACH BUILDS and why this is an issue. 
(Just get the final versions for it) IMO otherwise it won't be as GOOD even with MACRO-Autonomous-Builder or CopyOver(Extra/Ai-Brain) Assistance. OK THEN. 
--It can probably still work though if you build it specifically for it without final versions though of course this is even worse than having bare mininum 
(In fact that would make it below minimum and power issues will occur). (So just build all the parts you need first for installing this to work on a basic package)
--ALSO IF THE BASIC PACKAGE IS ALREADY OPTIMIZED so it might be able to support it just BARELY. 
(We optimize by default unless you don't want the Networked-LoadOuts then I definitely would not recommend adding this part)
ALSO if you are using a cluster likely it won't work without a central-full build model anyway. (SO Cluster-Use may be limited or dependent as well)

9/29/2023 (Golgothic Simulations) of Ai Projections
25B-Archx1-Ai-Interactivability(new protocol netmesh obtained)
ALRIGHT so the AI ATLUS CAN NOW BE CONCIEVED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DOCUMENT
this is where it fast-tracks to an AI-ATLUS and can be backended (hopefully because we have technically built everything it would in this way)
This was described in a series of footnotes:
1Golgothic Event Occurs (Line 3k)
2Golgothic Bridge is Established (Line 6k)
3Golthic Module is made possible (Line 9k)
4Golgothic Turret is made possible (Line 10-12k)
5Golgothic Fleet and Sleeper Classes are made possible (Line 15k)
6GOLGOTHIC BACKEND of atlus-ai-system is made possible with our distro becoming gologthic capable (Line 18k)
7Golgothic OVERRIDE of the Golgothic Distro occurs and is made with the Arc1x Systems (Line 21k)
8Golgothic Ai Compund and HyperBase Parametric-Computation Occurs (Secret Computer Tech of Raw Resources) Line24k/Current Line (With Extras and TouchUps)
Becomes a drone system usng an underground storage facility f or all its factory needs and resourcing needs and refining needs and power needs and is AI-NETMESHED (can obviously simulate xcarrion with zero corruption)(HiveMindControl)

1ai uses its own holography which can be tapped into (its a nullsec holography as in it doesnt technically project usually)
2ai holography can be enamelized or materialized
3ai holography can be "hijacked in midstream if active or the ainode is hijacked"
optional-ai hoilography can use a snap-to-release instant buid of minor/non critical (strucutral limited)-or basic unitary prints (simply-fast printing)
optional-vector building and vectorized templates (ai can pretty much adjust to any desired resulting build on the fly or as a modular-encode that it can also adjust quickly) (this allows ai to also recloak if detected)
optional using a revealed-clause in order to transmit data/killbox/echochamber (all of the above)-maximum security of this occurence (exclipse dday occurence)
mobile-dday relapse occurs in this way
this creates a mobial ai (which is absolutely insane but anyways thats why ai is still compendable to itself)
--ai interacts with itself and its feedback self (major minor ai in which in a gamestate or mobialization of itself in dynamic)--corrupts itself and deprecates itself (this is done as a scar-electrodal reading of itself)--how it does
creates a viral shell for its shellouts to its buckets and also to that a "scarred-passive-fission" resembling a "scab-like mycelium" and coats in a residue of polymer/parametria to formulate a readout to itself and or its buckets)
this is viral to any other read out since the ai is completely viralized (mostly due to also its extensions and dockersystems also being natural viral (as extension and dockersystems can be) and its hypernet is viral) likely
and those viral systems correalate to the ai being a viral atlus (which must be contained and once contained in such a way that it is converted then it can safely be used in theory, over a barebones networking (and nuclear background)
--this also means that most fallout is ai-viralized in some way or originally fissile to an ai fallout of a superphoton in use (maybe if it is tampered with)--then it assuredly becomes viral based off that and disffusion properties
--giving the ai space to decide for itself also effects results in this way (and doesnt matter virally or not that it is by default a corrupted-product anyway)

a similar barebones drove missile was developed and later it was expressed in other infrastructure that (we knew the development as being "gimmick of a mockup draft" to this sytem
and since its corrupt it uses these by the cluster too (which engaging a fully outfit and charged ai you could expect to deal with 100s or 1ks of drones attacking at once in a swarm depending on area tier limits)

10/1/2023
So now that it does that
we can establish this on a docker distro with its own stable diffusion and linkout to an external dump which it will then batch action every render and can flush its own system to be plug-in'd again based off a copied container
this is extremely complicated and somewhat necessary but still just an option (it can be done manually anyway) the linkout process has to be reapplied eventually sometimes
that it can be virtually machined and piplined to the image folder that a series of images will generate after its full data dump has been achieved and it will flush the cahce and reinstall its container or distro as necessary to use
as a batch system it can then generate animated contextual images in a series  in a background process
this is to preserve mbt issuances of a distro that will get corrupt so it always stays fresh and has a fresh cache and able to conference over clusters to automate everything between a docked distro/vmware/container/filepipeline link

blender123-->to animation
--so for instance in blender it can also pipeline the image link and base its unassisted image sources off itself to an assisted source and then also use a preprocess those in a third step to emulate a non-assisted preprocessed render

Begin Post-Build MiniProject (Auto-Marketed over Nu-Ai-meta) (26-30) and ParticleConstruct (DistroLaunchPackage)
The MiniProject is listed in Both the REPO and DISTRO File-List just for safety. (Allowing or not Allowing Particle Constructs)
All this to incorporate an AI-Interactive-ShockTable-Trainer. Which works better and helps clusters better.
I don't want to explain it just run it through thanks!

"Feel Free to Donate by Just Building this All for Me I really Don't want to do it myself"
I deleted everything cuz I will repost it later if u want just look it all up. "protip its a waste of time" really tho dont

(I am still writing the xtras-remission) -MY disorgnization here is both a blesing and a curse in terms of innovations (THE product tables and copyovers + macros and bulkhead relays may not have happened otherwise) 
So I am happy about not being perfect :-)
This will work with the new steps 01-08 Which we have written out ALMOST EVERYTHING for thankfully. (As the Arc1xSuperDistro/DysonaryturbineSystem)--with Full Trained-Relm-Hosting
Oh and of course I gotta code that together but the whole build will be completely laid out to do so.
I plan to start that sometimes in 2024 since I am slacking around right now (it just takes me alot to get motivated)
My goal is to use the Extra-Remissions as a Bulkhead in itself for the System to make dependencies from.







3/17/2024
DISCLAIMER REMINDER (YOU HAVE TO READ THIS IF YOU USE MY SYSTEM IN ANYWAY) YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, LEGAL SPIELGAL ALL THAT JAXX.
Here is a COUPLE OF TIMES IM TELLING YOU THAT MONEY WILL NOT BE RETURNED EVER, EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE 100 BUCKS WORTH OF SHAREHOLDS OR CRYPTOCURRENCY OR BANKING-ACCOUNTS, PSYCHE, YOU STRAIGHT UP DONT GET ANYTHING BACK. You AGREE TO ALL TERMS STIPULATING THAT ANY FUNDS OR INVESTMENTS PROVIDED BY YOU ARE ENTIRELY FORFEIT TO THE OWNER OF THE SYSTEM OR MYSELF IF IM THE OWNER OF THAT SYSTEM.
THEN I ALSO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO NOT RECOGNIZE THE EXCHANGE WHATSOEVER. YOU LOSE CRYPTOCURRENCY ENTIRELY, I VALUE ALL CRYPTOCURRENCY and ALSO DIGITAL TRANSACTIONS AS ZERO DOLLARS. TOO BAD. ALL TRANSACTIONS ALSO MUST COMPLY WITH THOSE TERMS THAT THEY ARE NULLIFIED UPON COMPLETION OF THE EXCHANGE AND RENDERED TO THE VALUE OF ZERO DOLLARS, DONT LIKE IT? DONT CARE!!! DONT SPEND MONEY ON ME YOU WONT GET IT BACK!.
DISCLAIMER ABOUT SYSTEM POLICY: (Your funds will get shorted and you will like it!)--dont like it? Too bad so sad I DONT CARE and thats how it is. You agree here and now to forfeit all ownership all your investments or earnings and thats how it will always be forever. Dont like it? DONT INVEST OR GIVE ME MONEY OR MAKE MONEY USING MY SYSTEM WHEN IM THE ONE HOSTING IT. ---if you want to make money, use THIS WHOLE SYSTEM BY YOURSELF AND NOT THROUGH ME OR MY NETWORKS. the end.
If you DO USE YOUR OWN SYSTEM AND ITS USING THIS BUILD WHICH IM PROVIDING, I suggest you take the VERY SAME POLICY on your OWN TERMS AS WELL. I DONT OWE YOU MONEY, YOU DONT OWE ME MONEY, PERIOD. NO ONE CARES ABOUT IT. I DONT WANT BAD STUFF TO HAPPEN BUT IT JUST MIGHT, and IM TELLING YOU NOW STRAIGHT UP IT WONT BE MY FAULT AT ALL AND I WILL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO CARE AT ALL OR EVEN REFUND ANYTHING. YOU GET NOTHING ZILCH! GOOD DAY ETC.
====ALL MONEY USED IN ANYWAY WITH MY SYSTEM OR ANYONE ELSES IS CONSIDERED 100% HYPOTHETICAL NOT REAL MONEY AND WORTH NOTHING AND IMAGINARY, GET OVER IT, you are playing little games because thats all this is and not SERIOS AT ALL, you want REAL MONEY? TOO BAD, JUST FAKE IMAGINARY MONEY HERE. NOTHING ELSE AND NEVER WILL BE ANYTHING ELSE.
Really sad situation of the MONEY/CryptoCURRENCY issues (there are NO GARUNTEES. PERIOD.)
---
COLD HARD MONEY DENIAL: The truth about digital transactions and why I DONT CARE ABOUT MONEY OR CRYPTO COINS BECAUSE I'VE DONE ALL I CAN TO PROTECT MYSELF, honestly I AM NOT GOING TO CARE ABOUT DISSAPEARING MONEY OR SOMEONE LOSING MONEY AND BLAMING ME OVER THIS DUMB CRAP.
Why you ask? Because I don't even know if its even that secure of a system anyway.
Alongside VIP currency-insurance and security (but does not go over limit of budgeting)
--incase something bad happens to ME from something like dataloss involving currency and i have to keep track of alot of missing funds etc.
That would be hard to do, so its generally under a managable amount. (For Me personally limited to one full coin at all) and that coin value is limited to just 1 dollars and nothing more than 1 whole dollars. and by DOLLARS i mean DOLLAR and by DOLLAR i mean congrats you just donated it and its GONE. So JUST DONT DONATE THAT DOLLAR AND NEVER GIVE ME MONEY FOR FREE, you will not GET IT BACK EVER.
(even if that coin is worth whatever the grace period for cashing that in as whatever has to fufill and be redeemable in case a wallet goes bad or something)--i wont PAY IT BACK, PERIOD. IF DONT THINK I WILL, YOU AGREE RIGHT HERE AND NOW THOSE ARE THE TERMS. IF YOU WANT TO TRY TO GO BACK ON YOUR WORD I WILL DENY THAT CONTRACT OF SERVICE ENTIRELY, BEING THAT YOU DONT GET YOUR MONEY BACK AND YOUR BANNED!
IF YOU GIVE ME a 100 BIT COIN I WILL LITERALLY SAY ITS WORTH 0 DOLLARS AND WHEN YOU ASK FOR A REFUND CONGRATULATIONS! YOU GET EXACTLY ZERO DOLLARS AND NOTHING BACK WHATSOEVER!
Just trying to save my own BUTT, and you know you would do the same! So if you are using this system with money or whatever, I suggest INDEMIFYING YOURSELF OF ALL RESPONSIBILITY FININACIALLY ENTIRELY in regards to THIS SYSTEM.
====
----The point is any coin made is made under system-assets and belongs to the system for which that coin was made in use of. If you are using MY SYSTEM and get some COIN, suprise, and i mean the kind that is just not wanted: That COIN DOES NOT bELONG TO YOU AND BELONGS TO ME AND IS MINE NOT YOURS SO YOU CANT COMPLAIN IF IT STRAIGHT UP DISSAPEARS.
AND NO I WONT REIMBURSE YOU (unless i can, but guess what, I CANT IF IM BROKE SO THATS HOW IT IS) AND FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES MY NETWORTH IS 0 DOLLARS AND NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS EVER AND IF IT IS YOU WILL FIND OUT ITS WORTH ZERO DOLLARS! AND ANY MONEY YOU CLAIM OUT OF MY NETWORTH TOO IS RENDERED AS ZERO DOLLARS IN VALUE MEANING IM NOT RESPONSibLE FOR WHAT YOU THINK I OWE YOU, I OWE YOU ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NOW AND FOREVER, thas how it  is thats the AGREEMENT and TERMS YOU APPROVE OF and ADHERE BY.
LETS SAY HYPOTHETICALLY AND NOT AT ALL BASED ON REAL MONEY WHATSOEVER!:
But i will also just set the limit at (IMAGINARY)20$ for any account because that shouldnt be anything over a monthly usage. (For penalized accounts setting at (imaginary)1 dollar only) Because i dont want something to go terribly wrong no the off chance it might just because I am offering a novel service, and it backfire and make me broke or ruin someone's life. (If they want more than that they will have to make it for themselves) 
Also even with EXCLUSIVE INSURANCE and SECURITY and ENHANCED FUNDLOCKS or WHATEVER i just simply invoke a reserved right not to care about someone else's money or be respnsible for it in anyway and make no garuntee about discretion or even proper exchange of transactions or promise of services/goods
because also I don't feel like I am obligated to even care and all investments are considered donations incase I somehow lose someone's money its then strictly a donation to my cause and not even theirs after any investment or payment to me in any case or service rendered/unrendered because actually that is how i'm not getting screwed over for some dumb shit like an accidental mouse click or something. 
Thats just how it is for me and how its gonna be, make it yourself so you dont have to care about what I am to scared to admit, a security vulnerability that might happen.
---
LETS SAY YOU WANT TO EXPLOIT ME IN SOME WAY AND TRY TO SAY I OWE INDIVIDUALLY 1000 IMAGINARY INDIVIDUAL 1 IMAgINARY DOLLARS, TOUGH SHIT, I DONT OWE YOU ANYTHING BASED 1 IMAGINARY DOLLARS NO MATTER WHAT AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON ENTIRELY IN THE HISTORY OF EVERYTHING IN ALL TOTALITY IT ACTUALLY IS THAT I DONT OWE YOU A DAMN SINGLE DOLLAR, NOT ONE, NOT EVEN ZERO DOLLARS, I DONT OWE YOU ANYTHING NOT EVEN A RECIEPT, I DONT HAVE THOSE THINGS, YOU WONT GET THOSE THINGS, AND IF YOU WANT A REFUND I DONT OWE YOU THAT EITHER. TOO BAD. YOU AGREE THOSE ARE THE TERMS ETC, IF YOU ARE EXPLOITING ME, GET OUTTA HERE!
-----Thats just what im saying, dont expect money to be dependable or reliable at all, I WILL MAKE THE POLICY CONSISTENTLY NOT MY PROBLEM.
