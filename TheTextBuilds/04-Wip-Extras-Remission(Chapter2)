With the first installment of the extras Chapter 1 we have an analog hub base.
It can also be that it acts as a swarm or has swarm properties, it may use relay.
It may use pheermoni. It may have its own raid boss or dungeon. It may have an xstem or built in tensor.
It may be frigate serviceable or even dockworthy.


projected at 3 to 4 months to 9 months for scarcity
so i can run a ditialized permutable i guess (idk)
this accounts for snuffin and censoring aspects as well in a simulation that is or required (compost code)/(compiled code scraps)
for a true upkeep i have to reconfigure that to be seamless and functional and not costing
so to have that work out in a digitalized permutable is the best option because its inevitable
so the rigging will rework into the formula that its on a cycle and the source coding procs
then i can print in an active state or an inactive state can be capable enough for a hardline
and i will hardline it to a full datasystem that will be it being done and i will work on a databank
this works now 100% and is wholly described as well
without going into real detial about the precise small software developing it will just run right
it is 100% theorectically nothing to be added except making it in practice work for what it does
the data bank is a theoretical build that will capture everything it can theorectically produce
and is the size of a giant file bin of 500 or so of these on that region (later this progresses to file building and is supported on the abs platforms)
so i can just say i have 500 of them ready to go if i can mass produce one theorectically then i can make a databank that functions for it out of itself
i can use the old coding to run with the databank and secure wrap it
with the coding wrap and the securi-wrap i can before hash checks of interactivity and diode
in case a sequence parameter is attempted by the environmental asset
it will show aggression and then release drones to patrol and contain them slowly over their practices
use the peg system to lock a perimeter around the supposed hostiles if possible and allow
the restricted to bypass their occupancies or bypass their occupancies with a hazard warn
use flags to identify hazard sites and keep undr complete containment until necessary
457K hazard sites in catalogue
but the containment can be field graphed by a scouting-station or site-branch
these will help to observe aether convention of the percieved event and run a detail report
these will co-parse with any simulation incurring if necessary it will be tagged
then the tag will be recscripted as necessary during the assessment or finalization of its ID
then the ID will be correalated and tested in various scenario systems and controlled settings--(labwork or workspace draft maybe)
this is known as the full peg prep where an object is profiled outside the drones regulations (FPP-remote projected-survey)(FPPS/RPS/FRPS/RFPS etc)
this will create a firmware asset that will be compiled into a testing mask for subtle recons
subtle recons will use the testing mask to scout for latent dysfunctional pathological errors (LDP-errors)--(through the entire build too)
these are put as marker and set into a group index of their tag lines
they are not interfaced unless preferred or via a median base of agent refactory contract
this will minimize mainsite involvement and maximize databank of anamalous activity and threats
any unknown or nonverified copy states of the system are viewed as semi threats --(THIS INCREASES DRASTICALLY IN HELLMODES with RANDOM OCCUPANCIES BEING PERVADED/INCURSIVE)
all active or high active group states are considered threats and individually harbored --(ROGUE BOARDING)
or detours are made to litigate against the incursion of their occupancy and are noted
the threats are noted and drone agents are sent to navigate their recursory --(OR EVEN MAGNET is APPLIED)
--
if they are considered eminent or deliquient, preventitive measures will be taken or noted (rogue assessment and diplomacy)
the issues will be handled and resitutated as a controlled hazard or uncontrolled outbreak (re+catalogued)
457 types have been indentified in this way (continued)
--
snuff chaffe field of blockade will be used to deter if necessary (generating fields or emf fields over asylum)
any rogue like elements that incur
the prim check and ampule station will also work to perform diode conditioning for sampling >??
the detail report will use diode sampling as an algorithm-sapling for containment and control tests
this test is called a script test that runs with a tagline in simulation of their detail reports
in case of outward polygonal transmissions are made as well from occupancies
they are correalated and tracked in the algo-sampling to the best ability providable (not always)(or on backroll consideration)
so tag/script with track/framerender via decoy beacons
this comprises of a ministate for a blockaded measure and can be re-set in testing (sometime) --(for tramission or xcommit)
it is analysis on various meta stage sets (using a render frame substitute in testing)--(or a buffer frame)
that is considered a mobilization of the regiment and is carried out in an exercise of testing
----FOR THIS may just use a RABBITMQ setup and message handling fork-provider then reroute to base survey channels (as channels are OBSERVED they are mitigated as necessary in their PLOSS/accelerations of FPS)
--
drones are used and strategically employed for a rehearsed engagement and confront test
---this acts as a MASSIVE-PLOSS-BROKER-SERVICE (for which can be better attempted under more developed systems, however this is the base system we had at the time (i.e. NO SYSTEM we had to make it OURSELVES)
--counterm ission is establish in case of ncursion it is pre-set to a list of other counterwork ---(mixed matchbases)
this forms a counter table for automated practices hwere security is enforced with drones
multiple parties are made enlisted and performed a full expenditure of their contract
--they perform an envoy of potential detial reporting known as a follow up or conveyed stations ---(RABBITMQ-envoys)
a diode may be indicated and if diode is successful a (guarded/chambered/pocket/distant)consort may be establish---(FLUX-MATCHBASES)
if consort is compromised then area is noted as a ware-site and full-warez is dispatched ---(Security DISCLOSURE/cleanup-patrols)
warez takes siezed data signature and locks all tranmission of hazard site (LOCKDOWN/DATALOCK)
then the area is marked as a warez or (defective and or/fullsiezed hazard zone)---REDZONE
300 zones are presumed as warez sites
and maximize with xproc prags on chaffe/snuff tag scripts for a diode to be boxed on a meta state (TRACKED BOXING TAGS)
this allows for a 3rd party consort on any license of mainsite
so that consorts can be interacting with out consort correctively
consort can also tranverse through pegworks if necessary
and testing grounds if neccesary for direct implmentating of domains (ENFORCED DOMAIN SECURITY DETAILS)--(Sec-OPS)
consort will also retaliate if necessary using admin control if necessary for staple gample (ASSISTED COUNTER MEASURES AND CONTRACT-INSURANCE/MERCENARY ARRANGEMENT)--(DEFENSE/CAPTURE MODES)
consort can be refit with also drone AI
and use of a command chain for other consorts under ranking (APPLIED STRATEGY/DIPLOMATIC REGIMENTS)
consorts can create templates for biome quarters for office holding on diplomacy policy
--

consorts may also handle blight and fel measures (nuclear/fallout)
consoretis(consorties and spells) required proper alchemical fel handling and orangeblight mixing
use for monitoring and meta monitoring screening (one for raw and the other for digitalized)
it allows for stacked biomes and residency licenses of aquired population assets in contract
this can be used with consorts to specify voucher use of carbon pass only thru consorts (Assisted-kiosks)
the limit for voucher expiry is 2-3 years(unless under ownership)
when it will be void or redesignated to original ownership and held into account as unused
there is also a voucher limit on day registry -vouchers are single use
and require consort registry if no queues is acquired then rollback may be prioritized if not
consort may or amy not refuse validation
so a firmware outpost can be used for that chapter
so i can wire another 8 together as
the four proc and another four proc
which looks like a small encampment base
for the (utilshack)(reactorshack)(spitbox)(procbox)
then it goes to the (securitystat)(consortstat)(procboxsystem)(beaconbase)
or simply put a minilabeler and a securityboard
or a secure minilabelr or titlemaker
the beracon board is really a script handle and can be compressed
it is used with an active render and can dispense item if necessary for proc
it can work and trade carbon vouchers or passe
as the encampment is secured with also drone workers
it can be used to coutner the joulethief
but is susceptible to joulethief
so it is considered a special case trap or special case pegstation
it runs as a potentiated peg station
it may work as bunker system ike as depicted (but built to those specification of its detail)
these are called trapbunkers
several types of trap bunkers including full trap and semi trap and work trap are used
there are also self sabotage bunkers that are built to be destroyed in a controlled setting
these are for economical repurposing of the articles involved
the self manifolding miniubunker (may require a securi-wrap in order to use arms to do so)--(a special encrypted voucher)
can use a construction template for itself or a quad base in order to do so in free-arm-mod
where a stand alone arms wraps is used on a flat template
this can self manifold, replicate itself, and rebuilt itself, into various box modes as needed
WITH over 200 box types in minecraft and thousands of core tools at its disposal
a manifold drone that can operate as a full toolbuild and resource gather (and escort)---as well as act as its own chest why not
a mass work order will be contracted per load of several drones co operating under guard
they will create manifold encampments and fufill the work order and contract the manufacture
thousands will be deployed for work based efficiency in resource gathering and construction
a total of 500+ bases will be constructed requiring the entirity of the count currently
there will be a 100 square grid of them x 5 to account for each as a table / full circuit table

--(Hallucination BONE-HEXGRAM)--a portal area in a dungeon

there will also be an idle drone unit dispatched to perform an idle task for its own purposes
the order is for 500 reprints of our base center in box format using 1000s of drones to
collect raw resources and apply and allocate the accounting of their work force
two drones will be assigned per work order
and a guard detail will be assigned to them as well
then an idle unit will parse the drone force and guard patrols
this will happen quickly and require as much time as it takes for a single person to make rig
it will be broken down as 30 chapters (1 chapter per horizon plus or minus chapters)
*rementioned: projected at 3 to 4 months to 9 months for scarcity
the drones are the size of a small house with mobility arms and legs and refactories
they manifold theselves to use the development of their resources and construct baseline
this is all set to a mass production line that is monitored and assured and assisted with guard
two drone will make the model equivalent of a full scale horizon using a supply chain as well
the supply chain also is guarded but not necessary to have a supply chain it helps scarcity
--
one box will also be designated for a siece dredge for hauling resources on supply chains
it will filter and shift through huge swathes of landmass and ocean and correalate its finding
then distribute the resources accordingly where needed via a supply chain of more drones
the drones if productive will make a Sieve Filter Base and a REfinery which will distribute lists
the lists will be sent through a supply chain as well and the minor orders will be filled --(barring scrutiny and voucher assessments/evaluations)
this also includes prioritizing battery use and transfers of munitions
this two step system is strictly for constuction and manufacture and not necessary
it will expedite the process
sort of like a giant metal detector it will detect and trace correct assessments of resources
for other worktasks such as mining and excavating which will require guardbases (or simple voucher allowances) and manifold
each ghuardbase and manifold is considered product line for other supply chains in transfer
having 100 baselines is not uncommon at a time (per resource in full supply chain)
and can effectively level 300 horizones (in full circulation)/(full circuit)
allowing for 200 more horizones upon later chapter (supplying further outreach programmed/process of resource)
this process can also be considered an abstract process from gathering/excavating
and construction and security
--
this will also be used to create a figitalized prim with the databank and manifold digitalization--(a ghost/lamp holographic unoccupied-surface/open-aquifir i think prior to usage--minimal virtualization)
these will be used with the encodings lines that are made prior to manifold (the exowyrds too)
then a digtalized encoded manifold can be reconstructed and send out as a robotic encode (collective resource module/node that can be supplicated as a source/origin)
the phyisical mobile machine that manifolds itself into a mobilized state using work digitalization
the work prims will be corealated with the machine and also made into a fucntionable software
this will be used as manifolding peg system
the peg system will work with the trapbunker and manifold to a full work prim reactor (remote usage and non-direct occurance...however mining is direct)--most of this is hands-free and automated to say
this will generate a prim kernal (touched up resource module that may or may not work as kernal)
which will fit accordinlgy to saving primes and reducing prim work it will transition properly
and generate the proper datagbanks correctly with the large system in play (world-catalogue)
so i have one system a databank and a primkernal (3 parts)
this can create a digital well system or digitalized recursory for he use of a full recorsory
or site contorl and can remote control direct algorithms if under full cursory licenses
it basically can overtake other systems through the use of a free-cast recorusory
or at least manipulate block objects if in recusory range it can be used as site command
because it wil synch with the machine that control it to do so it can use drones or control
control mass droves of them to manipulate for itself
following an algorithm that reads proper usage of the recurosory selection
having a monitor to do so also helps with targeting programs to allow command of

*harassment occurs*

mquery for the manifold as well
and the proc encoding can be used with that

*harssment*

So this is the next step, once thta happens and this sets up and im ready to deploy it all
we use the scrap encoding (whtaever the thing is for the etching that is lithographic)
that gets put into a manif0old system of course and the proc system already but now also
it is outsourced to an engine use that runs on the supply of that scrap coding (the lithotype)
in a way that not described as before it requires its own building of quads
using an old technique of the scrap-type, with the glitchmquery (mage-strata) the...static quotient
and a licensing of the joulethiefing (as the platelicensing quad cornering that is aetherized)
it becomes a very strong wyrd type i guess 
*harassment*
but you dont want to mess with it without clearence
--
causes a fall off and that fall off is reiterated as the wyrd particles (or positronic fallout)--beamsymbiosis (for use at a much later date)
*harassment*
maybe i weaponize it if i have to
*harassment*
shutdown and termination sanctions (20 year holding of assets)/freezeassets and force user account into suspension (if i had to)
42 schedule targets of the site index (the build so far)
12k civilian-residency and psyche-ward enforcements/administrations
*lieu of harassment*
30 minute interval *full cycle tazing of non subdued threats/hostile-patient (things like genocide and things required for POW terms)
4k patients in consistent front/warfront (standard battalion soldier assessment versus drone issues)---because whatever
457 days of diplomatic sanction
13 casualities assumed POW
"they survive the intervals and are rehabiliated and recuperate until they are forced into more episodal treatment"
daily...hourly.

This is also a potential DRAM channel for MemoryBase(ecc)
This Group creates a dram channel for ecc use. OF card and Gpx
This prim System is converted for basic circuit and rebuilt as working
At least that is the idea


that is THE TINY DRAM channel but i can have 100s if not 1000s of the now. --(i may have missed some properties but i built it as a module that can be put into place with all explanations on them)
i can make a big ligth nova and remote control it where i want (idk why i would)
i can make it also very flux/flexible with a framework that does what i ask (because of dram)
