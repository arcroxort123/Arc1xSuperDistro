With the first installment of the extras Chapter 1 we have an analog hub base.
It can also be that it acts as a swarm or has swarm properties, it may use relay.
It may use pheermoni. It may have its own raid boss or dungeon. It may have an xstem or built in tensor.
It may be frigate serviceable or even dockworthy.


*projected at 3 to 4 months to 9 months for scarcity
so i can run a ditialized permutable i guess (idk)
this accounts for snuffin and censoring aspects as well in a simulation that is or required (compost code)/(compiled code scraps)
for a true upkeep i have to reconfigure that to be seamless and functional and not costing
so to have that work out in a digitalized permutable is the best option because its inevitable
so the rigging will rework into the formula that its on a cycle and the source coding procs
then i can print in an active state or an inactive state can be capable enough for a hardline
and i will hardline it to a full datasystem that will be it being done and i will work on a databank
this works now 100% and is wholly described as well
without going into real detial about the precise small software developing it will just run right
it is 100% theorectically nothing to be added except making it in practice work for what it does
the data bank is a theoretical build that will capture everything it can theorectically produce
and is the size of a giant file bin of 500 or so of these on that region (later this progresses to file building and is supported on the abs platforms)
so i can just say i have 500 of them ready to go if i can mass produce one theorectically then i can make a databank that functions for it out of itself
i can use the old coding to run with the databank and secure wrap it
with the coding wrap and the securi-wrap i can before hash checks of interactivity and diode
in case a sequence parameter is attempted by the environmental asset
it will show aggression and then release drones to patrol and contain them slowly over their practices
use the peg system to lock a perimeter around the supposed hostiles if possible and allow
the restricted to bypass their occupancies or bypass their occupancies with a hazard warn
use flags to identify hazard sites and keep undr complete containment until necessary
457K hazard sites in catalogue
but the containment can be field graphed by a scouting-station or site-branch
these will help to observe aether convention of the percieved event and run a detail report
these will co-parse with any simulation incurring if necessary it will be tagged
then the tag will be recscripted as necessary during the assessment or finalization of its ID
then the ID will be correalated and tested in various scenario systems and controlled settings--(labwork or workspace draft maybe)
this is known as the full peg prep where an object is profiled outside the drones regulations (FPP-remote projected-survey)(FPPS/RPS/FRPS/RFPS etc)
this will create a firmware asset that will be compiled into a testing mask for subtle recons
subtle recons will use the testing mask to scout for latent dysfunctional pathological errors (LDP-errors)--(through the entire build too)
these are put as marker and set into a group index of their tag lines
they are not interfaced unless preferred or via a median base of agent refactory contract
this will minimize mainsite involvement and maximize databank of anamalous activity and threats
any unknown or nonverified copy states of the system are viewed as semi threats --(THIS INCREASES DRASTICALLY IN HELLMODES with RANDOM OCCUPANCIES BEING PERVADED/INCURSIVE)
all active or high active group states are considered threats and individually harbored --(ROGUE BOARDING)
or detours are made to litigate against the incursion of their occupancy and are noted
the threats are noted and drone agents are sent to navigate their recursory --(OR EVEN MAGNET is APPLIED)
--
if they are considered eminent or deliquient, preventitive measures will be taken or noted (rogue assessment and diplomacy)
the issues will be handled and resitutated as a controlled hazard or uncontrolled outbreak (re+catalogued)
457 types have been indentified in this way (continued)
--
snuff chaffe field of blockade will be used to deter if necessary (generating fields or emf fields over asylum)
any rogue like elements that incur
the prim check and ampule station will also work to perform diode conditioning for sampling >??
the detail report will use diode sampling as an algorithm-sapling for containment and control tests
this test is called a script test that runs with a tagline in simulation of their detail reports
in case of outward polygonal transmissions are made as well from occupancies
they are correalated and tracked in the algo-sampling to the best ability providable (not always)(or on backroll consideration)
so tag/script with track/framerender via decoy beacons
this comprises of a ministate for a blockaded measure and can be re-set in testing (sometime) --(for tramission or xcommit)
it is analysis on various meta stage sets (using a render frame substitute in testing)--(or a buffer frame)
that is considered a mobilization of the regiment and is carried out in an exercise of testing
----FOR THIS may just use a RABBITMQ setup and message handling fork-provider then reroute to base survey channels (as channels are OBSERVED they are mitigated as necessary in their PLOSS/accelerations of FPS)
--
drones are used and strategically employed for a rehearsed engagement and confront test
---this acts as a MASSIVE-PLOSS-BROKER-SERVICE (for which can be better attempted under more developed systems, however this is the base system we had at the time (i.e. NO SYSTEM we had to make it OURSELVES)
--counterm ission is establish in case of ncursion it is pre-set to a list of other counterwork ---(mixed matchbases)
this forms a counter table for automated practices hwere security is enforced with drones
multiple parties are made enlisted and performed a full expenditure of their contract
--they perform an envoy of potential detial reporting known as a follow up or conveyed stations ---(RABBITMQ-envoys)
a diode may be indicated and if diode is successful a (guarded/chambered/pocket/distant)consort may be establish---(FLUX-MATCHBASES)
if consort is compromised then area is noted as a ware-site and full-warez is dispatched ---(Security DISCLOSURE/cleanup-patrols)
warez takes siezed data signature and locks all tranmission of hazard site (LOCKDOWN/DATALOCK)
then the area is marked as a warez or (defective and or/fullsiezed hazard zone)---REDZONE
300 zones are presumed as warez sites
and maximize with xproc prags on chaffe/snuff tag scripts for a diode to be boxed on a meta state (TRACKED BOXING TAGS)
this allows for a 3rd party consort on any license of mainsite
so that consorts can be interacting with out consort correctively
consort can also tranverse through pegworks if necessary
and testing grounds if neccesary for direct implmentating of domains (ENFORCED DOMAIN SECURITY DETAILS)--(Sec-OPS)
consort will also retaliate if necessary using admin control if necessary for staple gample (ASSISTED COUNTER MEASURES AND CONTRACT-INSURANCE/MERCENARY ARRANGEMENT)--(DEFENSE/CAPTURE MODES)
consort can be refit with also drone AI
and use of a command chain for other consorts under ranking (APPLIED STRATEGY/DIPLOMATIC REGIMENTS)
consorts can create templates for biome quarters for office holding on diplomacy policy
consorts may also handle blight and fel measures (nuclear/fallout)
consoretis(consorties and spells) required proper alchemical fel handling and orangeblight mixing
use for monitoring and meta monitoring screening (one for raw and the other for digitalized)
it allows for stacked biomes and residency licenses of aquired population assets in contract
this can be used with consorts to specify voucher use of carbon pass only thru consorts (Assisted-kiosks)
the limit for voucher expiry is 2-3 years(unless under ownership)
when it will be void or redesignated to original ownership and held into account as unused
there is also a voucher limit on day registry -vouchers are single use
and require consort registry if no queues is acquired then rollback may be prioritized if not
consort may or amy not refuse validation
so a firmware outpost can be used for that chapter
so i can wire another 8 together as
the four proc and another four proc
which looks like a small encampment base
for the (utilshack)(reactorshack)(spitbox)(procbox)
then it goes to the (securitystat)(consortstat)(procboxsystem)(beaconbase)
or simply put a minilabeler and a securityboard
or a secure minilabelr or titlemaker
the beracon board is really a script handle and can be compressed
it is used with an active render and can dispense item if necessary for proc
it can work and trade carbon vouchers or passe
as the encampment is secured with also drone workers
it can be used to coutner the joulethief
but is susceptible to joulethief
so it is considered a special case trap or special case pegstation
it runs as a potentiated peg station
it may work as bunker system ike as depicted (but built to those specification of its detail)
these are called trapbunkers
several types of trap bunkers including full trap and semi trap and work trap are used
there are also self sabotage bunkers that are built to be destroyed in a controlled setting
these are for economical repurposing of the articles involved
the self manifolding miniubunker (may require a securi-wrap in order to use arms to do so)--(a special encrypted voucher)
can use a construction template for itself or a quad base in order to do so in free-arm-mod
where a stand alone arms wraps is used on a flat template
this can self manifold, replicate itself, and rebuilt itself, into various box modes as needed
WITH over 200 box types in minecraft and thousands of core tools at its disposal
a manifold drone that can operate as a full toolbuild and resource gather (and escort)---as well as act as its own chest why not
a mass work order will be contracted per load of several drones co operating under guard
they will create manifold encampments and fufill the work order and contract the manufacture
thousands will be deployed for work based efficiency in resource gathering and construction
a total of 500+ bases will be constructed requiring the entirity of the count currently
there will be a 100 square grid of them x 5 to account for each as a table / full circuit table

--(Hallucination BONE-HEXGRAM)--a portal area in a dungeon

there will also be an idle drone unit dispatched to perform an idle task for its own purposes
the order is for 500 reprints of our base center in box format using 1000s of drones to
collect raw resources and apply and allocate the accounting of their work force
two drones will be assigned per work order
and a guard detail will be assigned to them as well
then an idle unit will parse the drone force and guard patrols
this will happen quickly and require as much time as it takes for a single person to make rig
it will be broken down as 30 chapters (1 chapter per horizon plus or minus chapters)
*rementioned: projected at 3 to 4 months to 9 months for scarcity
the drones are the size of a small house with mobility arms and legs and refactories
they manifold theselves to use the development of their resources and construct baseline
this is all set to a mass production line that is monitored and assured and assisted with guard
two drone will make the model equivalent of a full scale horizon using a supply chain as well
the supply chain also is guarded but not necessary to have a supply chain it helps scarcity
--
one box will also be designated for a siece dredge for hauling resources on supply chains
it will filter and shift through huge swathes of landmass and ocean and correalate its finding
then distribute the resources accordingly where needed via a supply chain of more drones
the drones if productive will make a Sieve Filter Base and a REfinery which will distribute lists
the lists will be sent through a supply chain as well and the minor orders will be filled --(barring scrutiny and voucher assessments/evaluations)
this also includes prioritizing battery use and transfers of munitions
this two step system is strictly for constuction and manufacture and not necessary
it will expedite the process
sort of like a giant metal detector it will detect and trace correct assessments of resources
for other worktasks such as mining and excavating which will require guardbases (or simple voucher allowances) and manifold
each ghuardbase and manifold is considered product line for other supply chains in transfer
having 100 baselines is not uncommon at a time (per resource in full supply chain)
and can effectively level 300 horizones (in full circulation)/(full circuit)
allowing for 200 more horizones upon later chapter (supplying further outreach programmed/process of resource)
this process can also be considered an abstract process from gathering/excavating
and construction and security
--
this will also be used to create a figitalized prim with the databank and manifold digitalization--(a ghost/lamp holographic unoccupied-surface/open-aquifir i think prior to usage--minimal virtualization)
these will be used with the encodings lines that are made prior to manifold (the exowyrds too)
then a digtalized encoded manifold can be reconstructed and send out as a robotic encode (collective resource module/node that can be supplicated as a source/origin)
the phyisical mobile machine that manifolds itself into a mobilized state using work digitalization
the work prims will be corealated with the machine and also made into a fucntionable software
this will be used as manifolding peg system
the peg system will work with the trapbunker and manifold to a full work prim reactor (remote usage and non-direct occurance...however mining is direct)--most of this is hands-free and automated to say
this will generate a prim kernal (touched up resource module that may or may not work as kernal)
which will fit accordinlgy to saving primes and reducing prim work it will transition properly
and generate the proper datagbanks correctly with the large system in play (world-catalogue)
so i have one system a databank and a primkernal (3 parts)
this can create a digital well system or digitalized recursory for he use of a full recorsory
or site contorl and can remote control direct algorithms if under full cursory licenses
it basically can overtake other systems through the use of a free-cast recorusory
or at least manipulate block objects if in recusory range it can be used as site command
because it wil synch with the machine that control it to do so it can use drones or control
control mass droves of them to manipulate for itself
following an algorithm that reads proper usage of the recurosory selection
having a monitor to do so also helps with targeting programs to allow command of

*harassment occurs*

mquery for the manifold as well
and the proc encoding can be used with that

*harssment*

So this is the next step, once thta happens and this sets up and im ready to deploy it all
we use the scrap encoding (whtaever the thing is for the etching that is lithographic)
that gets put into a manif0old system of course and the proc system already but now also
it is outsourced to an engine use that runs on the supply of that scrap coding (the lithotype)
in a way that not described as before it requires its own building of quads
using an old technique of the scrap-type, with the glitchmquery (mage-strata) the...static quotient
and a licensing of the joulethiefing (as the platelicensing quad cornering that is aetherized)
it becomes a very strong wyrd type i guess 
*harassment*
but you dont want to mess with it without clearence
--
causes a fall off and that fall off is reiterated as the wyrd particles (or positronic fallout)--beamsymbiosis (for use at a much later date)
*harassment*
maybe i weaponize it if i have to
*harassment*
shutdown and termination sanctions (20 year holding of assets)/freezeassets and force user account into suspension (if i had to)
42 schedule targets of the site index (the build so far)
12k civilian-residency and psyche-ward enforcements/administrations
*lieu of harassment*
30 minute interval *full cycle tazing of non subdued threats/hostile-patient (things like genocide and things required for POW terms)
4k patients in consistent front/warfront (standard battalion soldier assessment versus drone issues)---because whatever
457 days of diplomatic sanction
13 casualities assumed POW
"they survive the intervals and are rehabiliated and recuperate until they are forced into more episodal treatment"
daily...hourly.

This is also a potential DRAM channel for MemoryBase(ecc)
This Group creates a dram channel for ecc use. OF card and Gpx
This prim System is converted for basic circuit and rebuilt as working
At least that is the idea


that is THE TINY DRAM channel but i can have 100s if not 1000s of the now. --(i may have missed some properties but i built it as a module that can be put into place with all explanations on them)
i can make a big ligth nova and remote control it where i want (idk why i would)
i can make it also very flux/flexible with a framework that does what i ask (because of dram)


THIS random MCELL just anywhere i put on the end of the calc near the calenders
Figurative Power Haul for a CMOS Battery Load that is Supply Chained
The MINICELL

HARD-FACT-ABSTRACTS COUNT:
i can virtuall abstract this dram with a spoke wheel and a piece of a nova-orbital
the ultimate form of abstraction if it bypasses correctly i can avoid 3,600tb of permutable (just throwing my thoughts on abstraction and how it takes a canvas the size of entire world to shoelace/breadbox together)
i would otherwise take 360 million years for the abstraction and permutable
it would take over 3 and half billion people to do what i need done in a day for half of that
another 3 and half billion people to abstract it correctly (would take me 7 billion people total)
with NO SLEEP NO BREAKS AND NO MISTAKES
not to mention it would need a monitor printer and keyboard and mouse and speaker system
to also be encoded not so much the speaker system is easy to get done (in stereographic waves)
plus you have to ENCODE IT TOO so i didnt count the encoding
and then to masic it all out for a capcitor overlcocking system IM NOT EVEN MASIC YET so not counting
the capacitors would have to be masic out and the circuit would then have to be DOUBLE MASIC
which would require a totally different built that also takes just as long if not longer to make
7 billion people for one system in a day and another 7 billion for the masic capacitors (reserve/capilliary i think, something i didnt have or use at this point)---or even technically have make use of a prosper/rail system to assist
then i would ismply minibox them and they would 7 terabytes together (alot of this is just spitballing ideas)
with a robot that can manifold it would take an hour (if it was done microscopically)

NO TRESPASSING
Homunculus

while 500 of these will technically make the full load for thep rinting station (i think abstraction threads)
they will be capacititated in a way they are also overclocked and interwoven with capcitors (they have capacitor-hooks/anchor points every fork to make it streamlined so its 3 layers--but im just doing one giant thread layer atm)
so as to be fitted on an overclock correctly
that project was listed as a seasonal project for one season to reach 500 in quota (IM SO FAR OFF ANY QUOTA I JUST GIVE UP AND GO FOR IT)

*harassment

core tools nobua (i think i was referring to a barista module)--as a nubuole as an ampoule (i do this lazy word thing sometimes)
fly nobau coretool set for prim (is very strong manifold)
using solar and lunar workset for (umbralight) which make for the INline abstraction (trying to assess easy shortcuts and plan by design)

*brain is melting down with 5g harassment and im going nuclear about it

with enough abstracting i can use delta p-ray tracing to isolate complexities of encampments (this is a theoretical special case quantum ray that just is any other ray)
this allows me to hybrid the system correctly through permatables and overclocking i guess
its very complex requiring all abstraction to a heade then an output databank then a rigging
the rigging is a computer with full functionable including equipment and gearing (much like this) ---a lever that actives the abstraction to be placed
the data bank is all the capacitory circuitry and pulse storage for the language and copy (translation of the abstraction)--going form lever type to next lever type (of abs)
it copies it into a readibly converted abstraction for the computer using masic
--
just complicates it and expands what i got from what i have to what i need in masic --(also other calcs can use it i guess) but takes more work to fit a shared masic for others to also use as their own as its their own etc (masic mods)
then it hits the cpu and i can use what i got already to make a ray trace within an encampment --(lightmaps)/(specmaps)
and formulate a complexiy off the event to act accordingly to the characterization of procs
all the programs are basically droned and ready in the encampment and characterized in act
then the state is played out to a calculation and integrated with a hybrid of permutables
the ray tracing and complexity form a mesh for a acting arena in which characters formulate
this is called interactivity and can be set to an admin access for "theatrics" and "expressions" --if not also contaminated by things like nightshade which is bad (but so can anything)
these later can be stored  as an abstraction in virtual and digitalized abstractions for analog (preventing any undetectable contamination that isn't already contaminated and detectable in its routing)--it can be contaminated but the system knows already if it is if it detects that it is or has been, sometimes its obvious or sometimes not so obvious sometimes suspect and sometimes just wild guess that it is, which brings it to question if it is, and then it is discovered if it is or not, contaminated/uncontaminated by check systems. (this is how rough security guesswork is)
the analog of that event is then calculated in a way that can be conveyed as an algorithm,
either the ray tracing, the complexity, the algorithm, or the abstractions can be isolated
that forms a contiguity too for external use of a offsite conveyed stationary transmission (masic decodes over broadcast too)
also i can use it with the level of complexity right now to just go ahead and work it into
the inline abstractions being templatable
some how that will filter out alot of unecessary replicating and gentrifying (to reach a smoother/streamlined encode format)
for easier permutable management saving me tons of time (even though its not perfectly secure in terms of unhackability, some things are just hackable)
also this station can be considered a locked manifold for a "delta" repository or energy well (scanner system and optix+ocr)
this will help with monitor powering and accessory power (if it can be power balanced to do so)
but it also basically the powerbox (which needs to be secured)
as to why there is that much of a battery (and room for a keyboard)--in the schematic of the overhead for the nexus builds
and it works and feels good mostly and is on a consistency check and a overstack check (EXCEPT ITS SO LIMITED THERE IS NO WORK-ROOM/ELBOW ROOM)
so overstacking and redundancy does not usually occur (hoping that i dont have to fix up more things to make sure it works)
the system will idle and perform a standby if necessary until a refresh is made (while draining that battery/cost effectiveness or not)
if every part is individually abstracted then its just even more easier but needs supporting
---
capacitors and banking to do so and would also be what i consider a huge deal with 2 circuits (in cycle)
but the two circuit model setup would be IDEAL (just takes years) so it can counter itself and therefore alternate
permutables also take full blown decades for me to write out (so i need to automate it by building a way to do so)
actually even thousands for databank permutables to be individually masic lined as well
not just for the system circuit but theabstracting of each part too takes centuries
then orientating everything correctly with itself is a millenial effort straight up for real (I DONT HAVE THE LIFESPAN FOR THIS)
it could take millions of years alone
(And it does cuz i did the math kinda) (almost a 1 billion year wait for the ideal system)
ironically encoding the system just takes alot less but building a little helps understand it (MY BUILDS ARE WEAK BUT MY IDEAS ARE BIG--therefore leaps are made)
maybe 30 years to encode it like a fresh operative system (not feeling up to it honestly)---BUT NOW I HAVE GPTE OR IF THEY RELEASE DEVON I CAN USE THAT
at this point just having designed an a.i. raytracing device is enough to say kinda "just get it" (thats all i can say)
so all the other versions that just dont work or are not 100% compatible just kinda have to "get it" (compatibility issues are so SO VERY annoying)
settle for "just getting it"
but the dram helps alot and all it takes it to make a decent ram device like this all (IM CHEATING THIS SYSTEM BUT USING MULTILPLE MODULES OF THE SAME THING AS A DIFFERENT THING ENTIRELY)(500 DRAMS = A NINTENDO etc)
its like apersonal ps5 display model, it doesnt work but maybe someone will make it work later (expound on the original concepts that is)
also its missing an entire 8x4 building sequence of what i said in the last week (NOT TO MENTION THE 8 OR SO LAYERS UNDERNEATH)
i guess i can put it with the roller to be honest and surround most of this system as a delux

this area could also be used in the line border as a WIFIbar (gaussian network field for the nexus)--i end up using a dynamo-patch
i guess i can make a sound system or discdrive (not really)---just COPY PASTE SOMETHING INSTEAD
nah decorating that is not gonna be great i'll just do a fill cuz im literally feeling the burn (of my nuerons)
but the 8sig makes more sense with that side so i guess i will 8 quad box that side at least (I wanted an infinity brand over the abs platform just like how i painted the gpu)
then do a roller fill (describing how i manage to fill in large gaps by zoning out---alot of times i dont and have to bargain with myself to manage to do it)
and that can be just the keyboard or the wifi or touchscreen or something like all of it (being lazy)
that way im good to go when its done right and i dont have to decorate the "junk"
--
about 3 week calculator been up and cpu been up 2 weeks (its 1-22-2021)
calc took a day cpu took 2 days
code line took 2 days so we at 1 2 2 and the other board color-in took a day 1 so thats 6 days
maight as well been 8 to clean it up the other squares took 2 days cuz i was lazy (intentionally mispell to indicate the severity of the task)

also sometimes the lay of the land looks like a cobra, sometimes the rail line fisbowls to look like california's state borders (because im high or actually too sober to want to stay that way...i take alot of hallucinations over the sheer weight of the task at hand all the time)

1 day for one side 1 day for the middlin and descriptors and 2 days for the lazy side + 4 
by the way it werent so lazy imo but lets just count the DRAM as a day too so +5
if i just fill that rest of stuff in a day it will count as 2 weeks operations (the abs and the end overhead-borders) + the 8 quads on the left side of abs
we can def say at 2.5 weeks its operational and really thats still alot of work and no breaks (so if it takes me 2.5 weeks to make a nexus surface over 5 years thats like 260 weeks or roughly, 25 nexuses) idk if my math is rite
im already overtiming everyday eat sleep and doing this with maybe a day off (it could be somewhat sped up by slapping panels with WORLDEDIT but i dont use that yet because i didnt want to) 
the alu comopnenting and the  mod componenting ok we can say is 2 weeks at right now and go

but want this roller done and i want the other 8 quads done and the wifi on it and the battery
so if i really didnt take a day break i would have had it done (this is massive cope to an already massive build)--and i havent done anything else but really just this nexus build and the logic gate, aside from a few other buildings and a frigate/business tower and a few auxilliaries and mod-builds and tiny/big block buildings actually i build alot but its not as much as say 25% of what i really have to do

and lets just asy 2 weeks oeprational but im doing this already overtime so its really a month (i spent a month here and there just always building)
i also ubilt a huge light board just fyi its huge
you know that took a couple of days and really i did that on 2 weekends not just one
in between building this i will have essentially made the monitor done and this done for it
this already is at fractal capability but i want to stabilize it like for right here (so it can scan fractally)
then i can chunk the region out to a continental bridge and just bridge line it thru the zones
will be good for the strained sieve and dredge and the sourcing will be very smoothed up
i will be able to use the agent/reagent (droid) + (the oophehavoc and onisieker room) in fractal---(this is basically obsolete entities but i might  bring them back as super powered entities) as strong as dragons
and that aint rely a small feat cuz they are remhandlers --(dream workers etc so i will probably bring these back)
--
they can fit right in the middle there with the battery np
that way i have two pizza frames to fill in

have to go play games and get off this crap cuz they buzzing like evil-b-ranks.

prim tier / analog tier / multi tier / permutable tier

this is the abstraction registry i build 1 tier then 2 tier registry to do this board overcloak
(i later add in proxy and power systems as well as the full file-table builder and injection over abs with aux)--way layer but the surfaces are mostly complete)

took me a day nap day to build that but basically 5 hours of work (and i had to arse myself to do it)
this helps me make a secondary kernal system of dram and ecc
secondary kernal run other systems like it same system and they can have secondary too.
i can run any system as like its same system on same framework using secondary boot drive
correct for any hard reset that occur and i am safely able to run as same system in network
that way i can run programs based off an image print like a real data chart
across board of other systems
then i can try to do a full interweave system print of a datachart in digital state
so i can dram channel actively
then i can abstract a command chain for the system
and encode full work contract and program them to full detail and resourcing
using calc output language in graphing
with no feedbackloop or overstacking
i can correctly permutable a work order
(this is important for later tulpa building)
so system + databank + printing station + monitor /accesories/sound/camera/mic/keyboard(kybrd)/mouse
goes to a full capable framework at a manifold
then i can successfully drone relay and communicate with drone direct over network or ai
i call that chapter 8

data sets language sets tool sets ... the memory sets all get something done (abstraction)
8x20x8 or alot of numbers of it all
can also be counted together on a giant mixboard of it doing it the parts + the wiredparts
this system is intact goes to a databank that is just as complicated
goes to the printing circuit (the double inlay is used then) and the full cluster of working)
1 2 3 4 the overlocking is double circuited now kinda (?)
works with the regular system or an xcore system too and is used as its own core
then i can quantum base with a dynamo

and use a memory cell correctly as a minicell
for the tulpa build in transir dimension
then i can use how i feel necessary for tulpa build
and use the drone relay for the bunker manifold
to serve the better repurposed echelon as an auroch (servient-canvas models--i havent added this in i dont think, but i will later)
the issue is the echelon is pilotable by a pmc augment --(dream chip basically but not as advanced)
will make it work for the drone relay and the tulpa build required
"our little guy/girl etc"
it(system wise) can also recieve instructions and command objectives
it uses a raw blend of coretools with a full abstract "angelic ai" (self commit)
which is fetched for constantly in its own capacities
or at least in a way that is consistent to its conscious functions
this is also used as a spore based tracking for their attentive capabilities of an algorithm
so we can effectively correalate command and communication practices
via interposed image docking we can memetically enhance the behavoir of an echelon
that requires a sustained system such as the entire board practice described prior
this is known as flyboarding --(and later flybuilding once we have aquired quasi-states/bitquos for that)
flyboarding may or may not be employed or stealthfuly censorgraphed for orderbased cmd (so it may rely on self commit cmds)
using several memes we can restructure a persona to adapt to an echelon and impart upon --(memetic relay if no object/profile is used)

ANALOG2SERVER Connection:
putting the edge protection here with the power supply
but also it will utilize quadpads of a new variety than previously
this is a boost variety that will assist efficiency in multitudes
using a masonic imprinting or spyrographic detailing in lining
also known for threading and outsourcing for asterisk heading
working deltanomically for a pulseline of draft and capsule
intended for lasergraphic algorithm use of a docking tray
will read inbound data upon verify permission and acceptable tables
screening pass as well for data to be screened before scanned --(not sure how this retains information other than using capilliary/reserve abs to do so in its holding or databanking of BEFORE server entry)
Also referred to as vacoule abjuncation tray

if necessary i can destroy that which is incompatible from firing below the board (idk im suggesting security)
various halves are known as assortment decks and the low deck /mid deck /hi deck / are used
or also the left mid right deck lines are assortment tables for topside midrow and bottomline
these are just zoning parameters
for focusing of quadrants via master sections to help hone in on active or inactive uses
everything again is under a carrier screening process that is not topside or boardlevel
the operation is basically a very large and highly schedule operation
it forms a queuesec or a security sec for its containment procedures
then if it is verifiable distributable based on work order it is shipped or not
all to user discretion i.e. command's descretions (that it works at all)
was done years ago on another model previously used not as complicated as now but still good
the wall of gaming must then been a dejavu material act so it can basically be twice as big then (i dunno what im saying)--there is a miniversion or something of what ive built for this (i might be lying idk/projecting lore)
in theory it was all a secondary passe 
we've constructed 2 floor levels in that manner regardless of the current count
that means two ghost shell roads with the 4 castles x 2 (im referring to the roadway i built a long time ago actually)
and two gaming bar measures on either side (with magazine base and griplocks)

*i have to take a break again because things just get too much to deal with i cant even type (im harassed)
35k slides to go

two repeaters for consecutive firing in alternation
plus the two carrier lines of both prior and forward including the base board and launch site
so basically this is all just an enhanced platform utilizing dual connecitviity in xfire mode
where 93% seen i used as a whole then 63% drop down abstraction and then xfire 43%
the enhanced xfire setting allows for a max 23% reduction total across the states with ghost
full functionality is as low as 23% in full reduction of loads some argue with phasing 13%
phasing occurs on both boards so of course it would be incredibly substantial for reduced
with the new alchemeillia droplet in raspmeta (or crunchered-refined-prism state) then as 3% (unrefined collab)
but that requires it in operation with the new prism that this is based on raspmeta (trifocal)

there is a counter ops against this from being allowed if rivals prevent it succesffuly by installing counterops bases in this way too (that they will attempt to hijack and assimulate my own factionops as theirs in this fashion)

using angeline sparsing (strong curve) and (celebra-meta)(gpu-prism) the alchemilla(prism)--(alot of different prism modes)
is also biparted and used of sieker coil displacement and standard nepling wyrd thaelering--(more modes in terms of native/locals)
8+2+(the trifocal supporting pillar) makes 11 +topside displacer (or bottom spurs) +2 so 13
the agelin steps in with +2 wingset so 15 and the wyrd tier based completes the set mostly---(honestly this is a local/native tech-deck as in a vdeck not a toy, performance)
with +1 thaeler to a 15 set (the thaeler set is complicated and may be used as a header too)
for at least 8+2(mid)+(1prim) +2(wing)+2(displacer) +(header 4-16) (+-whiptail or ribline +1) --a hybrid deck of local/natives
this is necessary to stabilize the alchemilla from fragmentation (a construct/mutagen device made of vdeck cores)
(which it will splinter or break)
then we can use insulation pillar with electrolysis and hydrolysis for that too on the PRIM
this will create a 3% full reduction and then we can probably achieve full reduction in PROCS
xprocs especially
but are minimal and only sustain themselves for a small duration before a COOLDOWN in siege
everything is used in other words with  both boards abjuncating the processes
so we can make a full quotient of the 2N or 2PI coreset that is also an isolated power cube --(this becomes somewhat important as it migrates to N/PI complexes and that can be used in later builds)
this can be used later for homunculi recuperation (and later aquifir recuperation which is not yet innovated i think)
this can be used to regeneratively occur portal stations for lower world travel
we can then send a drone to rehabiliate underworld biomes and return sucessfully (maybe)

this i can do a consistency check for corploss
which is also a carapace cytocheck
that means i can complexify and then simplify a complex system back to a normal set system (or use a polynomial to do this in a function)--(2n/1n+3n) or something idc
ven in calc language or arithmetic language i can set the formula back to step 1 post finale (so its ready for fast-launch/deploys)
and then i can screen correctly and fit any loss of datas (filler)
in peacemel or the like just a raw sequence of info (so it works until it cuts out and then it works again, or it gets scrambled a little and continues to try to work if ploss occurs)
then i can use pickups correcting it (compare model to other model type and try to fix or re-adapt)
so i can take whats mine back after the peacemel costs (so i dont lose my end of the exchanges)
i.e. sacrifilegeous encodings (so i dont have to commit unless i dont want to if im getting screwed or hacked)
the jumnp state will immediately rehabiliate the biome
for the system read out
then i will exfolioate and use exposure for a red state in alchemilla with a bust or zoning--(ecolabs)
this gets put through a hyperplex with a securitab (a booster used for securipads)---(security etc)
that will complete a secure onigraph (survey-access-render)
used in scouting and tracing encampments and full systemic settlements as these (non-game-survey access)
and identify them as incursive or warlike or a threat and monitor them with 167+ ranges
that can be beaconed into a terragraphic map charter and secured latera simple scout run indentifies 967 locations that should be protocols (as of 2021-01-26)
using excess and limitation restrictions
it uses a minicell powercore from the hyperstate powercell as described prior to resume jump (this later can be used as a graft for just about anything on any module)

The undecorated(mostly) Nexus surface is finished, this thing should work nominally as a server rack i guess
*anticipating harassment upon completion
3400 expected attacks due to completion (not sure)
10k defense measures made in case

abstraction takes like 120 layers by the way i have to integrate interweave and combine them
as well as perform multiouts and then reversals and then combine them again for pick ups
that takes alot of it to fix and then combine those steps into a working step for masics
1 tier and the other tier is to use it in a correalated sequence for primbasing without pickup
thats called primitive and raw tier
then the third tier is multiout moddable and the 4th tier is combine with interloclability(for capilliaries and reserves)
interlocking is the compiling of it
thats called a ribcage
i have to also do a ribcage for the section of the ribcage to maximize streamline that takes a year for the main and a year for the second main (i never really do this and just pretend its done and automated because it SUX)
not gonna do it so just say its there i guess
technically thats just 200 layers of boarding up more or less with spacing (or repeating what i just did that took 3 months 200 times)

*harassed between being constantly harassed over layers of mini-harassments too

the other part is i have to do both types of abstraction one for the droptier layer build
and the other for the full force method of just going directly to interweaving it all for
all the steps
using the steps as the layers themselves that way i will use the master slave system for one
of each
so i combine them into three abstraction threads (that each take 2 years to build)
and somehow adapter it
so each set has 1-2-3-4 complexities that are simplified 4 times each into other complexities(groups)
so 4x2/dropline and 4x2threaded and then those are combined into a compiled set and modded (from groups to layout-folders i guess)
4x2 + 4x2 +(compiled)+(modded adapter for MASTER/Slave) conveys a new header for
Master Set for Mixed and Master Set for Hybird/  Slave set Mixed and Slave Set Hybrid
and creates a header for all of them so 4x2 x4 (as MAST/SLAV)
as a header MOD for any of them of mixes of (MOD:MAST/SLAVE)
so 4x2 x4 now is x4 again into an x16x4 (idk)
or a full x64
based off four basic abstractions each that really just x64 x4
but lets say its just x64
what it looks like is  W+ X+  +T  +M
i didnt like that so i changed it to W+ X+  +T  +P with MASTER_+ or SLAVE_+ Usage : to 1-2-3-4 total query of WXTP or whatever or anything else idc or just (Master+ Slave+ usage)
So I can have M1 M2 and S3 S4 and also assign them in ranks of (idk im losing it actually and just trying to make sense of something i forgot or lost understanding of)
this can create full light pathing for routing in many sets of M1234 S1234 with Synonymous Use (i have no idea actually anymore)
I can have 9 states fully expressed for 8 states each (of their type changing and still so it wont matter)
or at least 4 states with 4 expressed each with some in ranking. That of course is obvious (not really, just that i can have and use data regardless of format or source so long as its from known SSDs/datacartridges)
then I just can make it presently availible for XYZ (data allocation or free-origin or whatever in ram or projection)
that means i can have 4x 4y 4z of M and 4x 4y 4z of S ...per M 'call in use'--Incase i need to rewrite stuff
or 12x12
and that would work as a ship ELS (i dont care what i mean)
or a full ship NAV works (able to use and host data while it is written or rewritten without overwriting it)
that means i can full board twice with 3 masic and a cardboard to essentially correct use (FORCE ENCRYPTIONS while rewriting over automated functions in cycle)--essentially making a new data-table used as an IMG/report.
1 2 ...3 4 5... 6 (how it takes data, complicates it more, then simplifies it heavily)---to make survey of a raw-count to an encryption-write to access-only
and make for the cpimpilation of that as 7 in OVCLCK (counting threads in optimized/maximized utility)
or just call it a CompClock (what is used for every thread-read)
and that will be a powershell output with contiguity (a very basic encryption of data and usage thereof)
it would take 6 years of development more or less for one board MASTER and 6 years for a slave (to form a matchbase on barebones-singleinputs)
would mean 14 years and then compiling would take a short assessment of the headers used (so it cant be cracked even then as easily unless the crack is adjusted to do headers/compiled abs)
this all can be fit into a DRAM channel for easy arrangement in digitalization (I WILL DO JUST THAT)
having said it, i would just encode it rather than build it or do both and thats just faster (just make it fast enough)
but not mechanically robust as having the actual build for it (either on database or on board or on card)
then it would all become a microchip that i can mass produce for echelon ray tracing.
BASICALLY ITS A PROGRAMMED CARD THAT REPROGRAMS DATA TO WRITE OUT DIFFERENT FORMATTING TO A new SOURCE or ETC.

or at least usage of our mechs will be tracable to us and protected (because it broadcasts based off its encryption we know it to be)--and basically its able to REWRITE A CARD (or DreamChip) as was mentioned it could (IF infact its virtualized to do so at all by having EVERYTHING ready for it to do that with..meaning it has to have the wholly built systems that are in use current data of 3/28/2024)
or by what i mean protectable
so i would have full board as that and a modded board to fit a compiling out to that the adapt ---(IDUNNO, i would use another NEXUS LAYER for this dedicated for TOPLEVEL SECURITY ENGINEERING)


the adapter will fit into the databank and resume computational arragenment as prior noted
with system adapted mod compiler +databnk +printing station +accessorized line for full pc
then the full pc will connect as itself obviously but can be set back out to a library archive
full pc can be set to a new abstraction board like noted before one that is non-integrated
so i will still use same build as before just the entire pc is on the first end of the adapter
then hopefully it will write and work and read the permutable of the algorithm in an xprocmod
and of course it will and can technically if encoded but to do it in the build itself is important
then it can automate its own digitalization for its own renders
and do what is required of it based on the work orders in renders
as an active frame workspace draftable render
sort of the strawberrybanana to bluebanana conversion for the renderspace
versus just a banana to tropical banana workspace
it will jus render b1 b2 b3 b4 as A->B at any stage
using itself and or it can reiterate as necessary based on its own build in digitalized states
so it can convey the print as a conveyed state print
then it can arrange conveyed state prints according to the build of its order
to print semi-accurate full scale models based on data-specific output
then i can also massproduce the types required to print correctly to exact specifications
using core tool sets in mechanical systems
semi accurate to fully accurate models
that prints out to a selected compatibility that can be hybrid exactly to correct model
for real transiet data hashing
example:
this is a transiet ender man potentiated as (_kyot_) for the time being
load in the simhousing for (_kyot_) and (_keoki_) and friends - hazards
later this occurs on its own time-release
--
pc crashes due to other things (overloaded)when the world memory was overused
--
3abstractions 3boards
databank (themakepossibledomachine) for sequencing into masic (compiling)
adapts it out correctly
all can be also +modded for doublesets(of2PI)
for core tool basics
so basically a giant interlocking gateway to itself
it doesnt have to interlock (snapstrapping)
it doesnt have to interlock (talking about locks)
but it can and heighten securit measures and security steps
this is called card correction (making up shit)
treats access asa system breach and notify seucirty algorithms of potential threat areas
also known as buffering and rebuffering (or allocated buffering and or designated buffering)
the header is a 3rd degree abstraction that helps queue correctly
and basically uses a full permatable
a full circuit permatable
that makes it basically a keyboard button to a keyboard
so i can just take this SUperSystem of 4 components and rebuild as a block base CPU
of all parts being technologically compliant
and simply capacitate them correctly and space and masic line them correctly if necessary
while assigning correct lettering etc
as a save state
i can also assign charting for programming boards and programming
it works hella good for mimicking processes or processing or mimicking processing or targets (it worksgood)
catalog use of a cross-artifact as deltanomic quad pi base of double set pi in deltanomic Cross
as a potential target taglog the CrossSymbol as that for now in targeting (maybe also its reticulated splines are important in target painting not sure what im referencing)
for cross-referencing

charge with typical carbon pass fines
as well as error-sums and checksum-concerns

harass*
current 1367 infraction list approx

253 small blue boxes now 453 small blue boxes (containment/deterrent)

alright so the adapter system is made to the databank to the compiler and is abstracted
then it is put to a monitor and accessorized and put on a prompter and used as a keyboard
then it that is an 8 in 1 system that is permutabled
it will work with 2d objects or semi 2d or semi 3d or 3d objects as 2d or semi 2d until rite
they can be animated and simulate a reality environment
--
--
due to abstraction working correctly in compilation with a permutable and a queue prompter
the save states will correalate with each others as a virtual environment
but i just skipped ahead not only the brand new installments but also the working parts for it
just the system is made into a dual-system for abstracting and carding out (auto-encryption based on card id)
that goes to the databank that goes to the secondary abstraction set to a compiler
that is then made into an adaptation and the whole thing becomes adpatered for realtime 3d ---(I AM NOT SURE, but I think this is the DROP before DRIP, and im not sure when the drip happens atm either IF that is the CASE)
--
and can phase in printing of realtime 3d or animated 3d or vritualized 3d animations (cell-3d too)
and install correctly using coretool templates
quantum shadow detectable - weighted algorithm panel (understands clones as their prints)
that can be also xproced (its the shadow side of the quantum side)--even that has a shadow side (so things get complicated from here on involving obverse sides etc or face/normals)

---*just as a note this also suggests having to coinside the surface with those normals being correalated in some way to the priority of their face, such that over the whole course of quantum-mirroring/bridge-networking is profiled correctly and matchbase is assigned and transfered correctly, or in some way its DENOTED the entry of any quantum-side interaction is SHADOW-type or in some form likely by QUANTUM PROFILE etc, but also that a SHADOWBOX can be determined or remain "indetermined" of its FACE/NORMALS but ultimately used down the chain of transfer/exchange that a SHADOW/QUANTUM type has been interacted with in some way, depeneding on unknown PROFILE STATES or otherwise, that it is eventually sorted out OR NOT, but is mostly ascertained as either trustworthy in some EXTENT but not FULLY TRUSTED/UNTRUSTED either, in interaction, or in SHADOWBOX-INTERACTION (which is later used in BRAND NEGOTIATIONS AND DREAMCHIPS)--but not right now, not at the stage this has been ascertained, only much much later.

darkness presumably it can be censored or something to make it quad based maybe contiguity.
--3/31/2024 (2021-02-14)
but free of darkness at the moment not engaging in the darkness circumstances it could be
it could be achemical priming
but after that i would be assumable that darkness is incursory
the darkness being the tendacny for casuality in heat death --this later prescribes to a virtual darkness taht has already entered golgothic-transfer (meaning the endgame tradehub of shadowcluster)--it best cases
it may be ballistics of quantum shadow parties ---(look at that, thats what im saying it is)--little do i know what and how far into that they are, being encrpypted etc
and then alchemical treatment and polarizing treatment which makes the steps in darkness
but therei s a quad fusion taking place between the hybrid quantum/signature then darkness
shadow im referring to is not technically darkness
is the step before darkness prep is incurred so its edging quite closely it might just be edge
it makes since that a physical edging and a quantum edging might apply (oldworld usage of edge/flex that everyone should already know even in legacy)
then alchemical is a stand alone system too and so is polarteching so thats just from my system
and darkness is the tendancy to commit the steps of heat and casualty
so thats its own system but its the bad kind --(and sometimes crown-point which i never ever mentioned until now)--which is peak-existence/godliness(not getting into this its complicated and my head hurts)
it might just be a fulcrum based of those three that make for what it is
and they fuse into their own quad fortifications which makes no sense then
so a good quad before the bad quad
for the holy/dark adjanceny in element (this makes more sense with a center-pieced aero)---aero is a technique i dont really know what i was referring to but its plasuable the case needed in whatever format im trying to suggest
such as the aero-lite that is condensed through its own balanced (magic photon or something)
as mentioned with dipolar lite aero lite being the advanced of it
then i might say it or what that refers to can be encrypted and reprinted in a virtual system
a contextual placated quasilite
that is then used in the conduction aux for prims and that makes the quasi-lite virtual lite
or raw aether lite
that must be refined via the flyer-process sequencebasing
that makes supposition through its compression to retain the data that it might carry (or not)
this will later be used as nodes that are called upon as summoning spheres
and are agents to a wireless rendering (magispheres or a nexus holograph/convention)
via the projection template of the summoning spheres
the area is warded for the manifest of the data carried on the light so a summoned object
is made virtually into a manuscripted printing
and assumes the role of a homunculis internal conscious from its own incarnation (i imagine this get complicated with actual FUSION being done instead)
this needs to be edged--(some place on the board)

anyways that section was a bitch to get done (no offense)--idk if its because im empathetic or not, i sense evil stopping me

RetreivalHUB--(AugorRetrieval)

SuperFLuid (grey)
All Columns are Hybrid Run X4 to maintain
This includes a ballistic partice netting that is posilocked (array/matrix/tesseract/tesselation)--later dithered
This is held in a (ConjureCanal) PlaqueExtension i.e. The slatepiece (departure based allocation and caching-invocation----auto-directory and auto-utlity upon call and request/demand of data-writes/reads)
Trying not to call it a domino but ya, its like a cylinder too (its not exactly anything, it resembles a bumper-stop like a rolled-bandage so it could be anything I am using as reference)
it fits in the socketing shaft and holds an enhanced beam (it reinforces the fit)
he beam is very strong for the root to be fused with counter (it can be an additive effect of fitting) --this is not a fletched fit, it is a primer fit basically (still snug/helpful or not)
this preps for a 3d projector box to be used virtually
Via the Stripping Manifold that holds the tagpiece
as a prism / capacitor for the beam (so long as its charged over via the lightwave etc)
the beam is made of 4 partice fuse by umbralite in light/dark
and the coriolis light that is posilocked and also the dipolarites (crystals made of that light reaction if any)

SandPanelling/(this takes the pury crystal and suitcases it)----describing particular panels with extra functions for their build (why i built panels)--that host modules with also more function

*endless despair and eternal loathing
i can barely be typing this junk its like working through SLUGS/SLAG---literally its unbearable

This is me building the monitor and all its components which is essentialy a broken grail: (we later monitor if it even works or just hosts a ghost as a lamp)---by the way these builds are no joke difficult in themselves to understand let alone type out
SoulCapturing Station/SoulResides in captured State here
The soul live withi nthe crystal a breathing A.I. ---NAME THE MONITOR (if you want)
---revistiing the homunculus site to see if i can tether it to the monitor at all without training (not that i really can yet or even am aware of how..i will get there eventually)

(There is just so much suddenly BUILT on the nexus from me going awal i guess)
It has the network side finished

The Final placement will be the diamoncrux
The board of cruxi-exhumed (a made up thing and title)
Each stone is contained and censorgraphed
Sabi The Ethereal (made up character)
Kyto-Quanta (made up chracter)
Keokei Astalus (made up character)
Runeki the lumichore (Coral Luminous) (made up character)

Ok so I built the monitor components and it swings out its diagnostics and hits the picks ups and is fed via the DRAM and REMOTE-CONTROL of the DRAM-signals which are configured and coordinated to host FILETYPES under AGENTS(madeupcharacters)
Some larp about summoning a thing and rescuing it and commanding it to ward off evil and fight back for me.

they T-sector it and it wonkibizes them.
it does the bamboozle bad
its the bad grub with the wigglers
the gagibonds (this is what im dealing with then and even now..i forget about how gags/ties are a thing) --hassle/hustle/harnessing/tiedowns for capturing wild/native/local/critters at best, not good for strong things
its good but for contiguity they have to do that above
then it does the crazifrazi business wisstints (static)
stints are all u can use to supress it (stints and filters)
otherwise it will make dysfunction in the accordiance (code hash)
it also does the chimepipes and the organs something for making itself ---a permtuable soundboard for code-signals (the permutable compacted for all the areas and modules on the nexus)--the waypointer basically for every component
but overall represents itself as a mechical tulpa with all the parts (an unmanned instrument and maybe even mask-set for subgates etc)
this is the cerebrues of the system basically (the lower brain)
it will tsector and hopefully with the innate mode of the hibuzz-biz-seq use it virtuall install (so netowrk is automatically reconfigured for anything else)
so the tail-end will be t-sectored t oo on a spline set (its using auto-networking to do so and basically hammers in those points into its table)
as seen in the monitor (the monitor helps to rework any network pathings)
basically this is like a legends of the hidden temple put the monkey together game to make the monitor work with this

Authors Note -- at the time i was experiencing alot of pushbacks for this dumb ideas being used cohesively, anyways, it shows that certainly things work together to string together a more proper partitioned ram-set as other profiles or even users.
I wanted to say other things i straight up forgot those little things i was thinking about because of how annoyed i am even now by continual pushback
its all encodes not necessarily the thigns i say they are, but oh yes, they can be evidenced over their actual object too, for which the code represents, to give more details than expected. (Alot of details just add up and i forget to mention them but keep in mind sometimes they dont carry over either.)
Uh...things like the xscopy needs to carry over for those details too as well sometimes, sometimes only are witnessed during certain xscopy, such as the carrion xscopy that details alot of thigns other xscopy wont. Like ghosts or things. (or exemas)
ALSO sometimes im not clarifying what i am saying, sometimes methods go overlooked particularly one where the XSCOPY is used invertedly. --but resembles sort of a star-print or buzzsaw that inverts its points over curves, which makes up for a large portion of what area may be under a target-paint/scrutiny of lens.
THAT METHOD of inverted-xscopy, also gets converted to a token usage as some of the first "dependent tensors we end up using" much later. But here, it am mentioning it maybe that its used as a monitor-range as well. So that the monitor can have those screens set into a position or diplay. and that range of course changes. it may change out as a localhost/or remotehost range. So the monitor can adapt and change itself over server relays and other xscopys...
as to avoid being blackedout/hacked. its complicated,
but the XSCOPY/XRANGE is one of the most important methods in use besides the XTOKEN being used of it in "punctuated-stats" that are plugged in over profiles, a monitor may even SHARE those profiles in a way multiple users are logged into it or its portrayed specifically across to certain users as however much info is shared in their usage, between themselves, 
its really its own MINIVERSE. (and damn its complicated--its like using a megapillar with multiple SOURCE-ENDS/POINTS which also...is a thing I haven't even begin to mention not even now. SEE APPLIED-COUNTERSURFACE/EXTRAS CHAPTER 2. --its just such an important snippet i left out in pursuit of OTHER advancements i think it should be reconsidered for advanced usages. 
( I ALMOST MEAN, i cant imagine how i got so far without it being brought up more than it is), it just really keeps me going that i can have some "lost forgotton tty flying around in after/code space" and that it may have even "evolved into something worth it" by the time i ever get back to it again.
Maybe even a personalized golgothic gate.
By the way-USING AN INVERTED XSCOPY, can have weird effects, especially when full-cloakfields are presentable, this includes "deep spots in the wave being altered further and may have strange cloaking effects"--ones that were not previously configured. This could be a bonus or a problem tbh. Either way...funstuff. And IMO, can be used in stealth-sneak to automatically "glide around better".

the soul is a conducted ion particle that passs thru the containment process but this will
virtual it accordingly if it is set to the right paramaters somehow
as a quadpiece to the set it will center-ampule the calibration of it taking place ((headers and domiciles))
itself probably working as a t-sector as its own functioning

the components make a broken t-symbol (that is such a t-symbol)
so it will be fully contiguitally processed either by the higher-systems of by the tsectors
its so stupidly seriously not even shown what it even does
it chambers a light in aa crystal that passes through a "quad-capture of elements" and then
hits the receptacle-table for that with the extra splines-set that gives it substance
passes into the virtualization cube and then is converted to a state wherein it is rendered
on the monitor it shows up as its being translated to a digital component state and is archived (ACTIVE-stream of encode overwrites/overrides per frame)
but also the t-sectoring is not shown because its a specialed t-section to itself
and  was used as a module to an already present placed system
so it would have been used for alchemy or light fusion etc
or exotification speaking of which was done so in a way that it was fortified later
to the exotic base then esoteria of the exotic stress base, then the fortification to the SUMS
the sums are the breakdown of using 1/3 rings to a 1/4 sequence ring of it being fully used
the 4th step is via a set of full systems in contiguity or something special like the last bridge
where the subsystem was applied via a containment process of hollowed cores
and then made with adjacencies etc
the issue with that is also the cane systems and etc
it would hold in a way that it would be used as a solidified interference chain to be scanned
then this 4-tsection happen
so we would microchip it with the prior combinational bridging
and that would be 2 sided systems (I've built the filetype generator and packet generator and somewhere described their processes i can describe them here basically)

the aux obtains a feed from analog and begins to convert it into a filetype which is cycled through modules to be orientated over a pulse-grid, the then then basically is folded into a voxel and contains the data-quo pulse, the voxel is refined and bridged out over a --bus, the bus is sends the compiled voxel to the "assortment tray"/thatch system, that ships it out to the voxel pulse which is captured to a holding kernal-header and picked up by a dram card/
the other side is that voxel pulse is packeted out from either the dram card or the pulse across abs, and set to its own socket-id for header usage where it sits so long as its sustained/powered and its voxel battery is programmed to be used. There are all the assets that it knows those voxel to be in an onboard index, of many tiny sockets that basically use the header/kernal archiecture to push on call a capacitor holding that data----there is a specific ARM that picks it up, called a reacher grabber, and basically crane-games it onto the cpu-bridge, which is symbolized as the overall token, the token is then "magnetized as encoded by the pulse-voxel and transfered to an onboard LOGIC-com / then reconfigures that output to the coordinator/remote which is also nexto to the dram.
BASICALLY THAT IS THE DATA LOOP THAT TAKES PLACE, then it is transfered to a monitor----later there is an adjacent proxifier and power-adjuster for volt-monitoring/brokering installed on the side. and the other side still channels that ANALOG data over the DATASTRIP that is also fed across the entire regional nexus circuit as the "ethernet". The ethernet also has another cycle combining this one --end in cycle we have basically our first dispensable-microchip-build.
known as the network signal and permutable for which transmits all that data that is made over to a gpu for further cycle. THE ABS CYCLE + GPU CYCLE + CALC CYCLE all work togethering eventually this way

I ADDED IN MACROS TOO BUT THE PICS ARE APPARENTLY SKIPPED OVER THAT HUGE CHUNK OR JUST MISSING. The macros all occur over the gpu stations. I will have to check everything later.
not all the GPU macros are there yet but the first ones seem to be
there is also a small security sweeper making rounds as its patrol has been set
as well as a soundbox (beeper diode)/the scanner is also built mostly (no scopy yet tho i.e. shielded remote survey)
The full networkmap is modeled too/ the full xstem is mostly visible connecting all the panels and monitor

2/15/2021
ANYWAYS we skipped ahead alittle, the nexus mostly has been built with all components and surface modules it looks great.


with these systems
on the main route
then this happened
we had just made a dual root system using canes and those side plaques in combination
this side plaque is also a dual plaque that makes a thing together
so the lightbead and the microchip form a positrack -statis light
these form a quotient of core tools called a queue-table (using networking)
cane systems came thru the original systems as well
so we said we had 3 better use for abjunctions
they would launch a second system on top of the original for infrastructured networking (over the full circuit)
1-2 and that would be dual root systems that were partially split for eac other
then core tools occured for fusion systems etc then a whole new blend of system took place
this using a callback to other formulaic approaches and modulates it for itself now with that (pulsuary)
wehere as had that before without this part (even tho it was 2x2 to 1x1 +1x1 making a quad)
now this is a quad with the t-sectioning also being pronounced as a quad that is or could be (its combining quads into hybrid and marginal quads so that it may multi-layer itself as needed)

AUTHORS NOTE:also i wanted to say that multilayer can also be achieved per module string being connected out in a full circuit. THE WHOLE NEXUS can be reiterated on the sum of its parts, some of the design is not as interchangable as others, but it gets to a point where if the majority of its part works it may support some functionable viability, and that being said, by design, several different module-strings can "cloudwork out" into a fully capable expanded network (not being a nexus per sae but an assembly of modules that work in groups) for certain tasks...similar to how an endzone would work (that being said a modulestring of all components too can work and fit to an adjusted or optimized layout, that an endzone can be made to work as the entire nexus eventually, while it is more recommended that the nexus be used, having an endzone deployed quickly in this way may also be preferential to additional benefits involved)
--though the endzone also has its own PREFERRED layout, it can have other layouts similar to the nexus modules needed or involve a hybrid of endzone modules and nexus modules, it really gets intense, and i just wanted to say sometimes the design or layout doesnt always matter, but its good to stick to the book for now. The benefit or particular layout may have pros and cons, and may in the end, not even really matter so much as getting everything done in the right ways first. (Plus the default endzone layout is pretty good too)--which was outlined in legacy but i can probably touch up on it again later.
also now that we are past that SLAG/SLUG brickwall of not being able to make progress, progress is literally running smoothly if not swimmingly, but im too tired to swim per sae right now.

itself a tsection or having minor t-sectioning to its major module condition
so this is a complicated module that does what it does with or without certain additions
those additions are also not noted as of yet (--it looks like the robot from superjail...uh jailbot duh)--but it really does (it looks like walee's girlfriend or an imac remote controller or something)
but involving the exotic-base and the sttress-base(carltable)--this is a base not regularly mentioned that i use and boy does it suck. also there is another version of this base for WORKZONES called hardycode(which is absolutely DUMB---)--and the alchemical/gemetric base is literally just a SPLATTER of -GAKbases. (its just awful but i know how they all are built somewhat off each other)---because they aren't normal or standard usually...they are "exotic" and i use them well. (not to mention the other exotic bases that they fit with which are on APPLIED-COUNTERSURFACE---but those are used in more divirgent process using MOBS/NPCS---but those can be used here too, infact i will make a footnote of those and these in a super-exotic-appendix...good to have)

so those three are addendum into being made into 4 via another quad system not listed too
but we know of it already because of the researches used (im very transparent about my shotcalls)--not looselips but fair and honest.
that the quad base system was a number turn of the system applied as well
this would be done via the multicalc side and the abstraction side 1x 1x
that would be added to all the other sides core table/comp grphx macro ram etc ---(and much later WISDOMbase which is at the very end of this all in APPLIED-COUNTERSURFACE)---crap its gonna get complicated AGAIN
proc base and it might as well just be described as a procbase xcore system that is used

but its also the alchemical system (if necessary to its  own steps) and the (lightarray) fused
(not to mention contiguity and tsectioning of that which we are holding off of at the moment)
so the root system would be applied with all that was described in a tier2 root system of itself
this would later rework into a fortressing pegitation in hicount for the network involvement (i think i mean hiparse idk)
---
leaving us with the previous canesystem#3 specialized as well for the new tsectoring
so the superfluid ballistix canal etc (plaquholding system)
that using lasers etc
would be used
with a holographic system so the cast-func or mask-func of the capture wasnt annihilated (when loaded then deployed etc)
therefore keeping it as a free radicle
and still it would go through a process if necessary (rebuilt) and later (reassessed and converted)
via the use of the spacing through the gap-lines (of 4specific parted quads) --as the systems inter-layering itself capable of doing (also its wave adjusting in extreme ways which is also good that i failed to mention or focus explaining of---this also carries over the entire development so thats something to note now)
then that means contiguity is availible for any quad etc(also contiguity normalizes this channel effect of wave-enhancements through its own profiles and buffering but still it can be "exploited for enhanced overlcocking" looking forward to that)--revisting legacy...worth it? Kinda-yah
represented mildly here
it would possibly occur as a misfire or a shortcircuit or a spitfire or a haywire (crisis complexes)--also hypervisory problems and cluster compatiblility of a buffer/screen
this links all the way back to the flywheel system (lets take a pause on that idea and see what im getting at---a link to the past here we go yet again:)
capturing them competitively like guassian readouts (idk...nevermind...maybe? eh..ffs whatever i guess...its a big thing to explain if so...ill just believe myself)
this would assess the particle as it is made partice of in the parsing of on multiple levels (sure ya ok what dat mean idr)
and make an extension for it being done so in the containment ok (ugh)
mostly unhindered yet adherent to the measure taking place remote (i dunno what im saying...its SPECIALCASE or something like exotic based screen streams or something crazy with info reads)
though  within the proper locations
so 1-2-3-4 installed root systems on tier base or something or 1 or 2 then the module for it.
to translate the data of all the parts of the system without inhibiting it
with little to zero corruption if any
and then it owuld assemble itself as such or be positioned in such a way that direct route is
this falls in line with the seamine-crystaldrop-surpsement (some type of trap weapon auto-data-reporter-agent thingy..a need in combat and unknown zones)
and the surmisal of that via the full-fly-measures (flyability i guess i dunno)
that the friction does not interfere being that it is made to alleviate in some e manner for xfer (this is straight up testing magnetic polarity and how it can result in departed quos or ploss--this is typical scienceTECH/pcTECH jargon.....experts know whatim saying here)
via the proc-overclocking (and then there's THAT...basically im jumping over many subjects to get to a big issue)
it would occur very  forsoothly or surefootedly to the old granulation of partice in gaussian (OK NOW WE ARE REFERENCING minipillars/megapillars...so YES THIS does bode interesting)
or would also comparitively work with free-contextualiztion of no contact i.e. no semantics (in data banks)--also data semantics is a new word for me at the time..and practically still is
the issue of vibration being present or not would both be accounted for if necessarily done right (BUT IM ONTO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT TOO)--just knowing a thing without knowing a thing...its another verison of data sematics that isnt data sematics or whatever. moving on
and it would alternatively occur with other data sectors to its emplacement of being analysed (auto-post or auto-processing or autopost-processing or just cause ITS THERE so its THERE auto-allocation)
there fore the process would remian within the proper frameowrk or without becoming triplines (because its autoprofiled in a frame to exist that way naturally in the time that it is there in its managed state which is subject to change and so on)
and the triggers taking place would remain undistributed/undisturbed and naturally occurent to its travel (it just goes with the dataflow)
that the prim diffractions of any amount of the factors of there being data would not disrupt 
superfluid would then normalize the contiguity usage and retain the information as it passes (it is the guassian-normalization)/(deguass)
and form a working potential for a t-sectoring of the memory bank
or a  memory-sector (now we are getting into memetics slightly)
that can be rendered as well as actively rendered for the captured diode in use
and then be adjusted for via prior system orders
and microscanned via the state of which is written (reversed imaged)
ALL THIS HAPPENS ON THE ROOT SYSTEM
-
while contiguity and alchemy and light fusion are reserved (reaching out to the asylum and training field for data --this program goes on a big loop once kicks off and is deployed)
i think there may be another system involved if its not exactly just this system itself (interactinvely interweaving its processes on a full circuit)
with the gap measurements more than likely (and it does this already without all the compatibiity work we put in, but it should be noted that those compatibility checks we made over the next years of development were super necessary for some development and possibly in the end, absolutely necessary)
and their iinfra-posing of the networking allotments (this may be brokered on its own exchange profiles too much later)
that the degree of which may be whole-base or as they would mentioned censorgraphed for (made a reliable signature if not encrypted just reliable)
hat the ampule or capilliation (life saver to invent that there, not saying it tho...it was just so dang helpful) of that would result in a veery strong read depending on size (less intereferable/distractable and more relaible/steady)
that occurs with the friction chamber of the particles detected (in all the intereferences it can sort out something that works at least try to)
such as a large coretool-set taking a symbol-graph during rootassignment (ok thats something we have to end up doing too)
ay just infact be a free-agent based off the coretool set having its own manifold-kernal
so the rootset would be an open socket to theoriginal kernal being placed and used instead
that the system is a manifold system not yet constructed under a coredevice (but will be soon i guess)
so it would be the housing for the pulse-rad or what have you that is use and assigned
using previous pitcores to be known in encrpytion would allows for a ufll read of encoding (parased encryptions mean a programm gets parsed if its used that way anyway it can assume it just works even if it doesnt know what it is, thats called dependency..but that is a very "distant depedency and vurnerable too")--in the case of probe attacks etc oh well forget about that for now
incase the free-rad is encrypted via its codetable (or codertable because someone gotta code it so its CODER-CODE. lol dman im tired)
at best is considered a raw input unless can be negotitated with inter-actively or preppedly
this would be best left to a virtual buffer of a hi-pegi board (because it takes some imagination to entertain that idea at all)
nd then the quantum-algorithmic stepline in weighting would be applied as a check base
his reverts the data to its recorded state and is either confirmed or verified at that time
if the data is unlocked or altered it can be viewed (by out root system i guess)
if it is appropriated correctly then can be interposed to the reworking of the deteminates (espeically with AERO-encode whatever)
 the "projection" may occur under certain other conditions included the nredered supply (power and driver issues)
 not then the capture likely fails (unless power/driver issuess are succesfully addressed)
and can be errorchecked or comparitively checked for remediation in some way it might work (HELL, lets remediate and error check everything again)-thats how it ends up working...just not right now per sae...when theres time later)
this module is eitehr reintegrated or non-integrated and left to computation measurements
leaving its status as pending or in develpoment (inactivated duh)
he finalization of the rasp takes palce and is either connected properly or released again (or postponed ...which we never really encoded later...SO NOW WE MADE SOME EXTRA TWEAKING WORK)
n inversion check is made and resituated to a proper staging for the setting of the kernal
so that it works or doesnt (looks like it willa t that point imo so its checked for MISCLONING)--wrong addresses or wrong-product or wrong-screen use and other errors
it is crucial that the clone chekcing take place under that criteria (i like using that word)
nd then it is set into place and then readily projected in the viewport as its passed through (simply cathode RAY tubes)
 may work cumulatively as well unless it becomes propegated by utility-residualization
where the connection does not hold properly it will simply not display the functions provided
that would conclude most of the cereberal interlacing taking plce in the depiction portrayed (yay our very first image i guess)
the remainders taking recourse to upkeeps and maintenences (if the projection is sucessful)
otherwise it may fritter into tehering and frays of prior code-indexing and meta-packets
as it would become disrupted (cahffe and static dynamo patterns all that)
 nature may even require further research of spyra and their rasps (if rasps are used)--basically BURNED -DIODES that still can be datamilled (oh they have a purpose as byproducts in some ways)
and may quicvkly become analmolous (HAUNTED)
the spyra may even be braced such as a conduction brace and also be used on an aux
but also emplacement as a turreted system so that the boxing of it is contained via censory/censorgraphics
alot of this may involved censorgraphic detailing of also using core-shielding(highshiedling) for safety (hypervisor-shielding tho we didnt have that tech ready and proven for THIS PARTICULAR use yet)--it might be ready now tho idk
or to prep the kernalization of the tact-patice in consideation to be prepped on a toolkit (autoprep yay ftw)
s its conducted made for a granular checking and protection of the granular deivce itself
a high-pegi base (hipegia..or something funy) system that has an open socketing toolkit device used for spyra emplacement (funny but serious)
for the impled kernal could also be set within as a dual system manifold hipegi-base-board
r keep seperated for the conjunction of there being one in used via a bracketing shell
whileing remianing under the positracking and interposements of based quo-tables ---(ALOT OF TERMINALS AND TTYS that are used to make the ONEMAIN)
that im describing would bea  fortress core-or dual core or kernal or to the effect coreroom (XTACT)
so the proper EPG systems tha occur do not disrupt or interfere with the process encoded
then the cryptography can be analysed and eventually uincloked for the release of info (shit man its like BRAINSURGERY)
during the transfer of the free-rad used in the provided proccing-tables that would read (THE FREERAD-takes its time before being moved to the next step...because so much diagnostic has to be done to it every step)
such as the intercommunication of the garygorels and such despite environmental, lockdowns (seucrity placeholders)--game designers know what a placeholder is...this is one (its been addressed probably)
as though whic aether will also be routed and handled if the system can redirect it to
that a hi-pegiboard can take manifold to aether and use as necessary then it can also
simply be used via aether emplacement of itself virtually
and correctively encrypt epg-transcodes or aether-sequences
in order toregeneratively supply the power rations under a relm cost
the free agent would be applied in the utlity of that hi-pegi manifold
so what we have occured here now is a seperate system that is proced and a proced-hy-peg
the manifold of which can occur under certain portability to its drones or carriers (NOT ONLY DID WE MAKE THE SYSTEM, WE MADE IT SUBSYSTEM-CAPBILITY READY or MADEABLE AS SUBSYSTEM)
--
so a manifolding ward that acts as it should if programmed or under command of the pilot
the pilot often being an a.i. construct of the tulpetic pilot that is trained to do so under systems
ould allow for a multi-abstraction to take place adjacent to fortified system infrastructure
system tha can work the system that is working in a way that its working its 2nd tier base
or the dekcing system to the full system that is fortified and the decking system is networked (SO MONITOR TURNS ON AND CHECKS EVERYTHING OR SOMETHING ELSE CHECKS EVERYTHING THEN MONITOR IS TURNED ON...and that process goes from xstem to any other part on the path by which it turns on and or is concerned to work)
that allows for intra-worldy missions to take place under the right upkeeps and conditions (everything gets threaded out and incase something isnt right it can be corrected via this way)
with contiguity shold be able to retain a full outpost of its secondary system (and if it doesnt work, well it might to some extendt be automaticaly diagnosable/fixed)


Authors Note: FINALLY that part is done. Please gpte just code this so i dont have to think about this one. (it wont be the last time a big patchup like this happens and is needed yet again, this is one of the first though) just look at those LINES!
