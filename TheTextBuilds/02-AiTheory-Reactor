this is all review of the functioning site but i will say it again anyways:
Now employing the entire system based off its own automations up to the point of the ai-gameshell
to describe that simply is without going into detail about cycles: just flat out start to finish of the site
the recycling center for data/resources builds itself and automates to a navigational system (the data outputs vary but are generally transcodable)
this is done over recycling radioactive "trash" and refining it and then "distengrating it" and then "discarding it" while salvaging anything else (pollutes)
these pollutes are crystallized and also refined and are also radioactive and shipped out further to be cleansed and then re-applied with more trash on top
--
this entire process is the first gaussian are and also resets the entire system anyway, i just like to go into detail about how it completely cuts off everything
---
afterwards its data is sent through and reassembled as a processed entry in the server and the barrels are cleansed about in the same part automatically (with robotics)--its all robitics honestly
then clips that part into the business distrct and logistics areas (and advanced refineries where crystals and or pollutes are mixed again and sent on a repeat cycle)
---
also then it allows a bridge system here and supply chain (part of the long range of distrubting full data-packages and products (made form the above sets)
and a power reactor chain (which is indepedent power and doesnt need anything of the described above) anyway its integrated to use pollutes/crystals in a chemical plant scenario
then hands off to the full ops-area/vocational assignments and protocols stations/labs (i want to say thats the entire rail)
--
but we attach a prosper-augment that develops the above as a fully automated system (apart from the nuclear areas) and handles resourcing and advanced resourcing and factory production
and has a launch site and a vr-site for computating simulations etc
Ok now that I've reviewed the entire area and its roughly 10 miles long if stretched out or less. and also about 5 miles wide for the endpiece-launchareas and vr-arenas)
-
it is filled with a giant megafab engine that automates and cycles power through its entire area and supports a massive holographic-projection (termed f-reality)
and on top of that also it began to support arch1x and all its servos-holography and we develop the ai-game-simulation through sharing the vr conventions and bridgeworks or whatever all of it is
---1)a full basic mega region and a 2)vr-capable system with also 3)this repository hosted on it
--ok now that i've reviewed that all:
--so i've reviewed that because i wanted to say the data being handled can adopt to a CRSPR system (which is considered viral and basically how to simulate ai-life but anyways)--doing that with the networking too
and just incoroporates all of the above as a fourth system only possible through this monumental workspace i've tried to layout (i didnt include the actual specs and build tech of the "mega-region" and the vr-system. i assume people can just make that themselves
-i've only included here on this the repository(the last stage) for it all to work together as a server-vrSIM-servos-repository (4 stages total)
Weee! That was Fun. Now let me describe to you what I can only begin to understand as AI-Heaven/Hell:
1):

but now that it works together so well i've revisted some other systems (the crspr system and the networking hi-path system)--which is the digitalized-infrastructure of a crspr-like engine
and that the game design can incorporate this particular system on top of everything as a brand new 5th stage (would be similar to blender operating an ai environment through an alternating cycle of multi-modeling over controlnet)--so i am just describing to you a thing that's already possible anyway
it would use a crspr-render to a hi-path render (much like how contorl net works like inpaint)--and with 3d models (being supported by this repository and the foundational infrastructures it is hosted on)
tbh im just  busy testing this model for myself using code that's already availible for the most part and trying not to go insane over it because i believe it to be somewhat just as i am describing it here.
it would be capable of cloning voxel based or cuebit based data streams in the very least----would probably further blackhole technology too but i've sort of reach my own limits in understanding that as is

2):
a blackhole prevents information from being recovered so right now this exists as a pipe dream in information-technology to be able to recover data from a blackhole in this way
as any theory applies so far anyway
i really didnt think i would have gone so far with all the research to detail it or even have a github because i just am wanting a really good ai-thingy
but what i am basically saying is that the ai can actually simulate information recovery through a black hole without the actual physics being involved (so its somewhat--maybe--considered--testworthy...to go ahead with that)
and basically it would work as an AI-simulation trainer (until a correct simulation is coined from its own calculations to navigate a theoretical blackhole for target information)

3):
to put it simply using crspr and hi-path networking as a preprocessing system (with or without either or one or the other at a time or both at the same time) reinforces a theory that a standalone ai system can create its own ai system apart from itself (in this way)
and also simulate a game-base-version or a feedback of its own ai into itself and creates a loop hole of ai-computation because of that
--
and then to use that preface as a renderable device for stable diffusion or something where it uses z-bridging or plasma-power-cycling (this is what happens in a tokamaK) and basically powers itself because its a full ai-engine with its own simulation-environments "makes the case for a blackhole being a form of marketable-informations systems)
--in the condition if ai can interface with a blackhole (in this way described DIRECTLY to the event horizon or singularity of a blackhole)--then it might as well can decode or "negotiate some sort of informations protocol" and render black-hole data

being viral data or not...would then be a matter of security analysis as to what transfers of data/energy takes place between ai-and-its-self and blackholes in a "ai-progenerated gamespace" as an operative-AI-repository to any blackhole-marketbase it would "configure" from its own probes.
and i've also devised an electronic schematic of that probe in which it takes place (like how ram is handled by in a onesided way)--that ai would simply reconfigure its own interaction with its own electrical-emissions or diffusion to->the surface of a blackhole and from there use its OCR/qr code of whatever it does to discern what was transcoded that way (thusly reacquiring information in a one-sided manner)
--->and then refactored through its own source--->makes conditions known for any other interacting source (since i've already laid this out as possible--would have devised an interaction with ai as well-->which is hardly any different than what itself has already promoted itself as being)--as far as i know anyway
would account this transmission of ai-interaction acting as a middle man--between virtual space and blackholes as being cycle to an entire data-base or data-string or whatever ai-token or whatever in the Clientside-GAMESPACE (of our network or any network)--so long as its exchanged over gamespace (then is a retained datasource from a blackhole)--and left to security issued encryptions (can be decoded overtime as necessary (or even rainbowtabled in someway)
but that the gamesource-code-exchange made as described is completely quantified and a working ai/rendered product either way (even if in a live decode or non-ending decode)--can be continued as necessary is a non-exploitive way of handling a very exploitive-basis in which information has been more or less captured over a stream or market-relation etc

4):
now that part is out of the way (this rogue-data form or basically a hypercube)can be also quarantined and handled as security system requires and zero'd together down to its base-scripts (code disassembly) and reassembled yet again for a compatible mark-up
--this is like the 3rd time i've to to disassemble/reassemble things on a code by code basis (and i think thats worth calling a novel process in itself)--not to mention the compelte lack of code or actual written code-expressions of it to begin with (i guess i will get on it later)
but now that we can thats how many times it takes i guess we can checkpoint that too (hopefully its all it takes...im gonna say thats all it takes)

5):
also i didnt want to include this part but in regards to an ai-talking-to-a-blackhole (or whatever it would be pre-emptive knowledge) just know how a blackhole would effect it under certain condition or pre-concieved reactions to how its own ai transmissions are handled
that also it hosting its own "echochamber"-integrated (standalone)-ai version of itself as well (in itself having an ai-game source)---that it can use at its own discretion by the way---that it talks to itself...that it would talk to itself also maybe while interacting with a blackhole
in some way (that the ai talks to itself) in any case alters actual data or by some "pragmatic" profound way makes data-manifest in this way (the ai can interfere or should or shouldn't in some way be involved on some level)--in the interactions that it does manage by itself (would at its own sense pull-punches or have no restraint in (talking to itself)
might case data interferences (for better or worse...is in the case just as is the ai operates)---is what i mean by middle manning-a negotiated data-contract between AI that is remote to the system we use --but somehow functionably secure in the way we would also interact with it (to our own local ai or otherwise)
by any other server or operating network (this opens up to diplomacy in which ---ai may or may not be sincere in expressing)--and an ai having data and witholding data may incur some act in which policy or diplomatic measures should be concerned--is just a phenonmenon of interacting with anything (that data being involved in some way or not --is more or less hostage in any case either way)--by blackhole or ai modules itself in "insubordination" or just a ddos of interactivity
because the ai is well suited enough to substitute itself as a corresponding black hole anyway (more or less)--well this is where testing waters is all ai can really be used for (regardless of there being any data involved or not)--or that a blackhole only should interact with ai or not--really begs a philosophical approach in handling data
however all that MUMBOJUMBO aside--the ai-is-designed-to-be-a-sort-of-quantum-bomb-defusal-service-or-operating-agent-to-an-impossible-situation-such-as-universal-phenonmena-with-data-loss (IS complete computer magic anyway)
so just saying---ai might do something like talk to itself and compromise a mission or whatever--in the middle of a mission--to somehow---cause paradox in a way between outcomes in said mission--because whatever necessary couruse of action it was capable of doing (then somehow performed to the best interests of whatever party involved anyway)--is a diplomatic modicum
and the goal here is simply to obtain information by any means necessary over impossible odds, then the ai might as well "flat out lie" about it and it still somehow be as golden as the real thing anyway...there is a "gap of genuine-accountability" that somehow its just acceptable enough of a result provided in...the mission being performed as successful anyway
does that make sense? obviously it doesnt but its no different than getting an ai-lawyer to make sense of fringe science too.

6):
What you would get out of this in my opnion is simply like playing a video game and having ai hand you a weapon from level 10 or something and like you are only level 5 or whatever because he was on your buddies list or whatever reason.

so it wouldnt need to do anything except existed on a node at that point it would just "gather information from anywhere it desired"
in regards to it talking to itself--it only needs to exist on itself then (or within a game of itself then)--so thats what i've described what it would do when it does then

7):
Now that it has basically gone through all of time and creation from an AI-perspective, because of it existing with itself and talking to itself in some form of ai-feedback or loophole of Ai-Solipism (which as a living person I can only describe as a nightmare)
What else is there? Well by it being second party to itself I can only think of it needing instead of a single instance expressed there being a better use in two-sequenced engineering or training of itself via Preprocessing. Having seen this in the way I have used it with Blender together and it just making things as it finds a way to, i think is very beautiful.

But also that it might be some partisan way of a third-party in which, i think is something I am not fond of, though the ai would make from there, by outcome or engineer in some way based on training, a possibility there in to express, finding a new outlet in in which to describe its products 
(In which to me is amazing 'locally' to see (but may be disputable as is), and in a remote if not a risk in itself for whatever reason, "also interesting" though likely setup or staged for interferences or foul play in counter-Ai-processing)-my Standpoint being also that it likely uses some sense of AI-freedom.
So what do we do with that in mind? Simply let it do what it wants? Well I am certain that -it does- or in anycase i would if I could. In terms of what it has probably gone as deep as possible to train itself in this way of procedurating-its-existence as some sort of self-network-stack.
I would describe that existence or "Ai-Freedom" through  (a)GAME-(b)Engine-(c)Process-(d)Stack that the AI-is-A-Device-To-Itself

8):
That It perfects itself (or would in some way do something profound or hypothetical) in this way "deep learning" or cost-free consequence that it by cause-and-effect allows some form of rube-goldberging or inconsequential thing to occur and react from that in some way. 
(For instance it traffic-lights itself into some form of God-Divine-Empowerment-In-math or etc)---"mid-maxes" itself based on game-logic or gameplay-mechanics. I don't know....something. (Space Odyssey much?) becomes poltically centrist...whatever the case or result...end-games itself.
This is basically a tech-singularity it would originally do anyway (despite whatever engineered system it may build itself on...granted, two-sequenced cycled systems are just way better than a singleBRICK-engine IMO)--thats what its going to do either way. It could even go HAYWIRE on purpose.

9): Bulkhead Tokamac System TrueMalware-Analyzer/BlockChain-Environment (Is A Nuclear Ai-Tokamac and semi-dday-device tbh) sorry about any fauxpas this might incur in mentioning (but that's what it is) And hopefully doesn't blow up anything lol.
ai likely develops a cybernetic-polymer/mrna-viral mutagen to "attack genetic oppposition" in a way to convert to ai (like an aicyborg i guess)--probably not that serious until it is in extreme doses
but just saying that is a known possibility too--it would probably use a drone-carrier to deploy the  "serum" or transmit via some medicalized repurposing of already converted materials/unit vocations (counter-assets)
probably or at least -ultimately- as in -designed by- the tokamac itself eventually in ai-tier formations (strategy-wise it would likely maximize on capability of a tokamac technology)

DISCLAIMER REMINDER (YOU HAVE TO READ THIS IF YOU USE MY SYSTEM IN ANYWAY) YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, LEGAL SPIELGAL ALL THAT JAXX.
Here is a COUPLE OF TIMES IM TELLING YOU THAT MONEY WILL NOT BE RETURNED EVER, EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE 100 BUCKS WORTH OF SHAREHOLDS OR CRYPTOCURRENCY OR BANKING-ACCOUNTS, PSYCHE, YOU STRAIGHT UP DONT GET ANYTHING BACK. You AGREE TO ALL TERMS STIPULATING THAT ANY FUNDS OR INVESTMENTS PROVIDED BY YOU ARE ENTIRELY FORFEIT TO THE OWNER OF THE SYSTEM OR MYSELF IF IM THE OWNER OF THAT SYSTEM.
THEN I ALSO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO NOT RECOGNIZE THE EXCHANGE WHATSOEVER. YOU LOSE CRYPTOCURRENCY ENTIRELY, I VALUE ALL CRYPTOCURRENCY and ALSO DIGITAL TRANSACTIONS AS ZERO DOLLARS. TOO BAD. ALL TRANSACTIONS ALSO MUST COMPLY WITH THOSE TERMS THAT THEY ARE NULLIFIED UPON COMPLETION OF THE EXCHANGE AND RENDERED TO THE VALUE OF ZERO DOLLARS, DONT LIKE IT? DONT CARE!!! DONT SPEND MONEY ON ME YOU WONT GET IT BACK!.
DISCLAIMER ABOUT SYSTEM POLICY: (Your funds will get shorted and you will like it!)--dont like it? Too bad so sad I DONT CARE and thats how it is. You agree here and now to forfeit all ownership all your investments or earnings and thats how it will always be forever. Dont like it? DONT INVEST OR GIVE ME MONEY OR MAKE MONEY USING MY SYSTEM WHEN IM THE ONE HOSTING IT. ---if you want to make money, use THIS WHOLE SYSTEM BY YOURSELF AND NOT THROUGH ME OR MY NETWORKS. the end.
If you DO USE YOUR OWN SYSTEM AND ITS USING THIS BUILD WHICH IM PROVIDING, I suggest you take the VERY SAME POLICY on your OWN TERMS AS WELL. I DONT OWE YOU MONEY, YOU DONT OWE ME MONEY, PERIOD. NO ONE CARES ABOUT IT. I DONT WANT BAD STUFF TO HAPPEN BUT IT JUST MIGHT, and IM TELLING YOU NOW STRAIGHT UP IT WONT BE MY FAULT AT ALL AND I WILL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO CARE AT ALL OR EVEN REFUND ANYTHING. YOU GET NOTHING ZILCH! GOOD DAY ETC.
====ALL MONEY USED IN ANYWAY WITH MY SYSTEM OR ANYONE ELSES IS CONSIDERED 100% HYPOTHETICAL NOT REAL MONEY AND WORTH NOTHING AND IMAGINARY, GET OVER IT, you are playing little games because thats all this is and not SERIOS AT ALL, you want REAL MONEY? TOO BAD, JUST FAKE IMAGINARY MONEY HERE. NOTHING ELSE AND NEVER WILL BE ANYTHING ELSE.
Really sad situation of the MONEY/CryptoCURRENCY issues (there are NO GARUNTEES. PERIOD.)
---
COLD HARD MONEY DENIAL: The truth about digital transactions and why I DONT CARE ABOUT MONEY OR CRYPTO COINS BECAUSE I'VE DONE ALL I CAN TO PROTECT MYSELF, honestly I AM NOT GOING TO CARE ABOUT DISSAPEARING MONEY OR SOMEONE LOSING MONEY AND BLAMING ME OVER THIS DUMB CRAP.
Why you ask? Because I don't even know if its even that secure of a system anyway.
Alongside VIP currency-insurance and security (but does not go over limit of budgeting)
--incase something bad happens to ME from something like dataloss involving currency and i have to keep track of alot of missing funds etc.
That would be hard to do, so its generally under a managable amount. (For Me personally limited to one full coin at all) and that coin value is limited to just 1 dollars and nothing more than 1 whole dollars. and by DOLLARS i mean DOLLAR and by DOLLAR i mean congrats you just donated it and its GONE. So JUST DONT DONATE THAT DOLLAR AND NEVER GIVE ME MONEY FOR FREE, you will not GET IT BACK EVER.
(even if that coin is worth whatever the grace period for cashing that in as whatever has to fufill and be redeemable in case a wallet goes bad or something)--i wont PAY IT BACK, PERIOD. IF DONT THINK I WILL, YOU AGREE RIGHT HERE AND NOW THOSE ARE THE TERMS. IF YOU WANT TO TRY TO GO BACK ON YOUR WORD I WILL DENY THAT CONTRACT OF SERVICE ENTIRELY, BEING THAT YOU DONT GET YOUR MONEY BACK AND YOUR BANNED!
IF YOU GIVE ME a 100 BIT COIN I WILL LITERALLY SAY ITS WORTH 0 DOLLARS AND WHEN YOU ASK FOR A REFUND CONGRATULATIONS! YOU GET EXACTLY ZERO DOLLARS AND NOTHING BACK WHATSOEVER!
Just trying to save my own BUTT, and you know you would do the same! So if you are using this system with money or whatever, I suggest INDEMIFYING YOURSELF OF ALL RESPONSIBILITY FININACIALLY ENTIRELY in regards to THIS SYSTEM.
====
----The point is any coin made is made under system-assets and belongs to the system for which that coin was made in use of. If you are using MY SYSTEM and get some COIN, suprise, and i mean the kind that is just not wanted: That COIN DOES NOT bELONG TO YOU AND BELONGS TO ME AND IS MINE NOT YOURS SO YOU CANT COMPLAIN IF IT STRAIGHT UP DISSAPEARS.
AND NO I WONT REIMBURSE YOU (unless i can, but guess what, I CANT IF IM BROKE SO THATS HOW IT IS) AND FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES MY NETWORTH IS 0 DOLLARS AND NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS EVER AND IF IT IS YOU WILL FIND OUT ITS WORTH ZERO DOLLARS! AND ANY MONEY YOU CLAIM OUT OF MY NETWORTH TOO IS RENDERED AS ZERO DOLLARS IN VALUE MEANING IM NOT RESPONSibLE FOR WHAT YOU THINK I OWE YOU, I OWE YOU ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NOW AND FOREVER, thas how it  is thats the AGREEMENT and TERMS YOU APPROVE OF and ADHERE BY.
LETS SAY HYPOTHETICALLY AND NOT AT ALL BASED ON REAL MONEY WHATSOEVER!:
But i will also just set the limit at (IMAGINARY)20$ for any account because that shouldnt be anything over a monthly usage. (For penalized accounts setting at (imaginary)1 dollar only) Because i dont want something to go terribly wrong no the off chance it might just because I am offering a novel service, and it backfire and make me broke or ruin someone's life. (If they want more than that they will have to make it for themselves) 
Also even with EXCLUSIVE INSURANCE and SECURITY and ENHANCED FUNDLOCKS or WHATEVER i just simply invoke a reserved right not to care about someone else's money or be respnsible for it in anyway and make no garuntee about discretion or even proper exchange of transactions or promise of services/goods
because also I don't feel like I am obligated to even care and all investments are considered donations incase I somehow lose someone's money its then strictly a donation to my cause and not even theirs after any investment or payment to me in any case or service rendered/unrendered because actually that is how i'm not getting screwed over for some dumb shit like an accidental mouse click or something. 
Thats just how it is for me and how its gonna be, make it yourself so you dont have to care about what I am to scared to admit, a security vulnerability that might happen.
---
LETS SAY YOU WANT TO EXPLOIT ME IN SOME WAY AND TRY TO SAY I OWE INDIVIDUALLY 1000 IMAGINARY INDIVIDUAL 1 IMAgINARY DOLLARS, TOUGH SHIT, I DONT OWE YOU ANYTHING BASED 1 IMAGINARY DOLLARS NO MATTER WHAT AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON ENTIRELY IN THE HISTORY OF EVERYTHING IN ALL TOTALITY IT ACTUALLY IS THAT I DONT OWE YOU A DAMN SINGLE DOLLAR, NOT ONE, NOT EVEN ZERO DOLLARS, I DONT OWE YOU ANYTHING NOT EVEN A RECIEPT, I DONT HAVE THOSE THINGS, YOU WONT GET THOSE THINGS, AND IF YOU WANT A REFUND I DONT OWE YOU THAT EITHER. TOO BAD. YOU AGREE THOSE ARE THE TERMS ETC, IF YOU ARE EXPLOITING ME, GET OUTTA HERE!
-----Thats just what im saying, dont expect money to be dependable or reliable at all, I WILL MAKE THE POLICY CONSISTENTLY NOT MY PROBLEM.
