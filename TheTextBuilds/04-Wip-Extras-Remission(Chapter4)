Disclaimer:PLEASE DO NOT EXPLOIT MY PATTERNS RIGHT NOW THANKS. They are intended to work as is described atm thanks.
Mostly BUILDING A PROXY TABLE

It makes a variety of consumable brand descript labels
these are known as schematics or data prints. for building onalso it makes semi meta-packet fixtures based in recycled|compile
1st mini cane system
the mini cane system uses all over the rigs
and can be recycled once used like a 'cheeto' bundle ---use this with censographics/nox even idc
enough minicanes can equate to a full super aux
a super aux can consist of any amount of recline
a rec line may consist of many rigs but an aux must be capable
(aux header and aux adapters are also added on the aux extra)
these can help to forge an aux deckline which can be multi-fit/out
so a bunch of power rigs and shit like factories for snacks with rocks in it
making cheetos
with like ten stacks of that on then what tracks up to being a side shelf etc
basically not the thing im doing
basically this runs on a meter base next to the original runtime
so the 9 piece system can be a 10 piece system
want to add more cane system to it
and i can use canes on the super aux deck
i dont remember what the cane system do except go to root and get merged
cane system 1 is about admin access
cane two is with the read outs
so mini canes are with the templates for admin to have readouts
on auxdecks
canes and minicanes will form an easy shelf too
with admin and basic readouts for also things minicanes(tooluses they do)or do with infrastructure
the mini canes make use for semi-quotients that are later put into metapackets and fulltables
and then makes cheetos basics (garbage sticks)
that are basically pak control for browsing under the browser set (we use a browser now)
if there is nothing to brose then forget it, just make packets for later distribution sets
so as to mitigate power structures can be used to actuate packet usage throughout the rig
which is sort of like a poweredraw for the metaserver which will also store metapackets
this can cause interlining with glint base and glint shielding (long straings)---its a sneaky thing so its kind of like----infiltrating
strains can be read later at stressed capabilities (for any more...readout?)
so not only maximize capability and addon resourcing and equipment but also cane systems
this will form later as a basic datapool to accurate predicate chain commands
---
corsair base will be applied for light-shielding on mbase packets in memoryblocks (imperitive)
so it will cross interface with the system
that has its own canesplits so other caneplits(forks) can be compatibile between rigs and decklines
this creates a network bridge between the aux headers and the modules etc being adapted
then aux-header-module-adapter can be resourced to the proper mblock for command chain
the command chain being from the original full circuit in acive render then can relay priority
priority is relayed in alternation or in other words very fast half steps that are seamless
or Direct relay as per the proxy pac designating the parameters of the routed datastream
then the root can allocate as neccessary between all level of exclusivity via plug/play addon
with admin controls and permissions as well as district based gateway and security permission
so the 9+1 system can be throuroughly locked down as a 10 system
I would call this 3rd stage advancement
4th stage is it being somehow parased with time succession of its run sequence and strains
that occurs as a licenseship or certification process on a browser state
using the registry and other formatting devices with abstraction and abjunction adjacency
conjunction correaltion and its all conveyed through the fortifications of the browser check
then it would be able to take aux quotients and recoordinate them based on workorder parse
then can be fully edited in a way that the product is not finalized or later finalized accordant to it
quotients can be securi-pinned with basic encoding if the rading has algorithmic locking reads
so the reader would have to be an advanced model and encoded directly via the system
so using the fulltable of encoding availible the system locks the quo for as lock as needed
then can also unlock it later using an applied basic algorithmic in adjusted freq-lines
where a combination of frequerncies reads out as a unlocking mechanism for the data-pins
then the base data quo is readable again but bulenrable to passlocking as well so optionally
pin use is optionaly accounted for in the read and transfer of quos where it may nuetralize
this can also b used to chakra based conversion method for power resourcing via keypass
in other words user based direct secured lgostics and logistical record keeping
a disembodied core tool can be used in a redzone to transfer otherwised locked data
if regional heirarchies are considered and appropriate keypassses are used to supercede
circumvential protections are also prevalaent in other systems as well so its all dependent
then perform a corkscrew  of crypto-graphing theirs against yours via a crypto-coretool

literally random coordinates to anywhere (best guess)
10684.3 100 120384.3 i dunno
-10684
tried to find the WPAD to this thing in the game just typed in the coords i thot it would be

my second guess for the wpad is in the deep lengths
this is another have at it being a negative side it looks pretty dysfunctional here feels bad too
this got a response (random coordinate i dc)  -102345 100 -128454
that might be them
some tnt i left
some lava i dropped

put a charge vest on that guy
*harassment response

the box can be put through a red zone and stationed so
a semiquotient etc quadgraphing will form a security grid
and be used as a basica tripline tryptocoding for security
allowing more build prims and slots to be recoverable
this can be symbolized as a enderchest etc
and can recover for a personalized storages of data and reports
but there is no promise for  security that ists secured
the power grid is a disembodied tesseract

StoneScuter Framework for RouterPosilock can be proxied
boxeguard defense array
reworked via proxylabs and paklabs
is aligned and locked via cloak shields guard patching
use caneSys quo for patching
use cane system quo for lab patching
use setuptools to adjust fixture of proxyboxe
the stone scuter can be locked and 'shielded' via keypasse

condensed memoryQuotient with shielding and x-proc
teleports and reappears thru electrodal nodes in system build
this can cross-link throughout system

uses shielding to protect data is meta-basic to logic conversion
pre-router node
red shielded and interfolded data memory bank quo
red shielded and interfolded data memory bank quo basic-->logic
3 x station addon uses secure gate pathing and disembodied xfer
essentially a power grid that can attach as a partice handle
uses freq resonance to attach and xfer carried packets

--want to mention inverted-token spyrgraph issues in proxy making wpad/xvisa USEFUL

can also be reserved with t-section tacting
via t-section tunneling and pack-switching on layer-relay
i.e. macro-packet
macropacketing is used for A.I. and algorithms in Source-Xfers
-
Source Xfers are always fully keycoded and secured via admin
requires license certifcates permissions access + passes
tethers and can ensnare pactets en route & redirect
Uses Basic-->Logic-->Meta-->XprocQuos/AiQuos
94% memory load
can be used to acquire algorithmic nuance quos
an a.i. nuanced quo beacon (post)
full access and full security required for full lock use
also known as a hook rod (the rod to a latch hook)
-
used in automated flail-packets for contiguity xfers
requires quad work meta-cog capable quad-manifold
4.latticebase 1.cog-system 2.focal sensor 3.nettlebase
this is symbolized as a tag piece orr via decal in labeling
this allows for data tagging via the label in scan /readout
example of tagged-label that cryptograph the memoryload---MEMORYMODULE checker
4. 3. 2.a 2.b 1   (4 step system)
this can gloss data via installation kits of its program
and therefore allow for easy render of data via xprocs
xprocs are converted to a standard memory via conveyed ram
conveyed ram may also be networked on seperatePlatform
Mini Cane 2
-=-
Minicane3
Minicane4
Minicanes x4 that compile as 'mini system' for memory banks ---MSGPACKET-BUILDS for potential PACKET-mails (for brokering into storage)--using computer MEM as applicable conveyedData (convertable inline data forks)--a proxy basically
mini system can be modulated with other cane system (depends)
---CaneSystem 1+2   + MinicaneSystem = Memory Integration
This is also interpolated at its full functional patterned actives
Using Preps for EZ Render adn their convey active render
then presented as a full render via compartive model usage
minicane/full system/ ballistic node/ routing shell:station  --attempts to route to proxy
ruperts fishbowl lense liquid tunneling 1 2 3 spiralswell 4 as per an isomer
qullbase normals in tesseract surrounded iso-data-line
leads to a conduit deck-coasting charger station or emplacement for conduit (old conduits)
used in 4x quantumgraphs
--
hypergraphs can also be used as recoordinatable callboards or something
so an active map if anything that can be used from central hub station or platforms
en i can easily make full render products and use for render plantations
then this system can throw whatever i want whereever i need it templated
technically even in redzones if proper resources manifolds are accumulated can plan it
it can also reconfigure itself to encode differently if necessary using multi-pads or multipak
which is useful in barebones situations---BAREEBONES-NOX
i can then effectively use barebones templates with a preset for preline of base templates
so i can xfer lock sets to locked rooms that will not be intercepted in most cases
can be used with multiple aux lines and rec lines to occur desired quality
currently 4-5 is preffered
so all my aux lines and their reclines or the pakline or the dramline
4 auxes included old aux the super aux, so 5...2auxworth of rec 7. a dram and paklane 9.
i can also used advanced security lines for rec and aux rails or the rem-drift rail for 10
so i can have macro aux lines assigned designated for certain function outputs
so i would use full macros or semiparsed macros using layered function of present macros
i would use like 15 aux lines to effectively defend and protect my baseline
8 Macro Base x2 (x4) (x8) (x12) (x16) (x24) (x32) macropot
--
CaneSystems1
MemtaCane
Dram1
pak 1
rec2
rec 1
aux 3
aux 2
aux 1

these can all be set to specific builds of their own builds in patterns of their builds used
i have it linked to auxlines and paktables and somewhat datables and other systemtables
each space i can fill in for it to be used for a way or a certain thing of a way that it is
and i can then layer the macros to use a custom layer set so the orders are arranged via
a macro table and permatable or multitable or encoding table or customtable of partial tables
i can make hundreds of macros here just for that until all tables are used i guess a 1000x
basically so this system can be output via quotientpass and installed on an express manifold
each time thre is a switch or a series of switches used it will install if prompted via console
so its a mini work-deck for mini orders of the manufacture of templates its a template order
i can then have certain templates designed if in request or contract i can arrange quickly
basically i can have an encoding tell how to make the dataprint or render or i can order it
with the way its printed and how and when or what parts are used where in what way its done
and adjust where needed or on the fly during mobile or active usage make and perform edits
and then also if necessary roll back the order or data print even if its being printed out atm
because its a handle based on sequences the sequences can be paused and or backtracked
this is a data router that can also effectively be used as a data sequencer
but i can just make an actual data sequencer somehow later
have it use a devtoolkit to virtualize itself being a software for the data sequencer in a box
a box like that
for boxes like that over there i can just shelve it if needed later
so long as the rig retains the memory or stays active as it would require print linking of that
o all that is made on a raw print out i will just shelf the print out and have the box allocate
any  print out i would need for it to be designated in arching the print out itself upon request

*harassment
barebones redcast module and officedotting of any intrusive activities will be documented
this form sort of a shield formula that also must be noted as (oppositionally vulnerable)
the shield formulas was being used prior to the pak machine in rare occurences even earlier
macros can be set to convey gloddrenderstate (potentialized)
if request is paused or coordinated in a delay weight load
this will help mitigate computation requirements
but effect renderRates
--
macro applicator (uses timerbased) integrated determinate)
it may also be used for inversion assignments
this helps assess when data is supplied
this is an injection or encoding toggle
where and when macros are deployed and use allotted/reserved
may use gloss pre-rendering to asess macro for  sequencing
--
Creates a full system circuit emplacement for templatebuild
or a command manifold fob station with recline and decks
can be used to merge alchemy tables and light tables
with auxlines and quadbases
and inverts them to binary basic logic serial etc (and keypass pins)
--
inverts data to baniary basic logic serial keypass checkpin
isomer deck for conduit use network conduit

7 based system

aka the ballistic quo box
also i can make sequencers with beacons and a conduit beacon
-
standard post beacon (depicts self/depicts offsites)--allows for expansion to offsite areas
survey beacon (connects to offsites)--allows for offsite monitoring and connecting xfers--for listening of offsite activity
power beacon for manifolds (allows offsites)--allows offsite control and construction manifolds--for retained encampments
conduit beacon for advanced relay (proxy beacon)--security control---this is for emplacements and siege encampments
--
these can be sequenced into a defense array
they can be interlinked to other conduits in added-security
Full T-section battalions can be deployed via capsule template
--
example of small canister for fast draft of vehicular units
using TagLocking Templates ETC
These can be used in Fast Gate tRAces in Active|Batallion
Can also be T Sectioned for Multiple launch or Stock
--
Mini Tsections Contiguity
x4
currently operating at 42 total platformswith out conveyed usage
convey usage would require full drill capabilityof the entire working system board
or quasi drill base for gloss refinement and fortification
and layered ribbed funcs and metaruning
for drill tessract
with algorithmic inlay or weighted empowerment
for instances for virtual siege tunneling pak mitigation
the mitigation doesnt happen unless full aram is in use
forgot to mention how aram can count as a level 10 macro too
this is useful with engine braking determinates and containment
---
tsection aram blockades would be a prime example of a full conveyed use
where tsectioning is couple with cane system
as a tertiary system or 2nd part system
this would require implanting to unify system in conveyed status
this is used with a defense mechanism that is found in skymines
and can work on several layers along side original platforms
as a controlled airspace or nav space or oceanic space in virtual space
for other use its own relm space so a relm biome may be used for it
for a contiguity space it would also be primed for prim space and therefore a counterspace
so it remains inboard
as a coretool table it can be used however necessary to render its runtime or its workload
this cna block or intervene commands if necessary
with t-section based core tool kits

this can essentially block a quadlock commands (or quasinuke chain)
or convert or invert it as necessary for reconditioning of the construct or powersource
as a freeagent to the original compilation of the data taking place it could extract and obtain
able to force edit of parameters to meet expectation and the nretain or remediate per use
also known as a feint or feign command
similar to fetch and retrieve commands and prior commands such as search/rescue
1 2 3
of course there are others but those are non interactive commands basically not for units
such as "find and replace"
"lock/loak" or jokes like that
this is for data usage and acquirement of data and mitigation of the proxies involved
after they are used so they can be bridged properly
seek and destroy that type of thing
 helps compensate for the bad end hokes of that spectrum
it just helps mitigate power requiremetns
ts actually imporatnt as power is currently very strained
so this rig is very necessary to alot of the data computations and rates of that in loading
so the power load itself is handled to thehighest calibration despite its supressed states
--
shipping and packaging check safety quality control check
checks integrity of capsule manifolds and canisters
things like lock and load etcit beocmes disembodied f or xfer and launched basically to the site pad
fter a quality check for power restraints
sort of a diagnostic sequencer
so im pretty much set to massproduce it so dont be a problem or i retaliate again

conveyed stack of resituated etc rebuilt reconstructted etc rehabiliated recovered weapons
assess and analyse
attain and acquire
this is all so t-sectoring can occur multiple objectives rather than one primary
secure and protect etc
12 parts here connnected to 6 pairs or simply 8 or so steps
then it becomes conveyed again as it would be emplaced as per the order made to emplace
------suggestion for a :proxybus maybe:

harassment
so 40 attacks are occuring around me atm that i need to address but i will just retaliate

using multiple math systems including a modular system from the lineation chapter and integration
as well as spiral detail and goldenlog chapters which i am very intertested in seeing work out

2-24-2021
so that perhaps a solf-algorithm can be obtained or implied
maybe implement a firing range
outside the borderlines
--
miniseq midseq regseq medseq hiseq tables 1 2 3 4 5
i guess psection tables too
this will allow for aethermeal usage (which is discarded or low quality aether)
they can refurbish the low quality aether to substitute for in place of normal use sometime
usually as a filler or a temporary emplacement
and can be used in project work electrical boardings
or scud use at minimal extents
i.e. minimal use power rigs
or as a compose decomposer
-
or to help use as cusion or flak shielding for teflon or kevlar
or residual paneling for fiberplex or for the sluciing dram/register-line // dredgeline or for barge stacking
any of the secondary resources can be substituted if necessary should be carefully done
it makes decent chaffe if moved as a decoy or proxy chamber
can also be used for annihilation repurposing of context utility or product base manufacture
everything can be used for a low quality rendition of its being used as a junk-or-compost

--A gas-case enclosure
Milktooth-SharpRegulator-ExtremeFrame-SucherateFrame
These very lower quality frames assemble as a gamete zygote
That is later capsulated and abjuncated into a seal (used many)
So that there are chances ai can formulate in them thru prox
these can be in exercise of the firing range they use to work
Gamete/Zygote/Usages may Over Sparse
Limits and Excess Protocol but are not to be 'corraled'----remains to be debated tho
They are considered the cohabitating ecosystems
and will be relocated as necessary
considering their potential status and effect
appropriate pretense will be formulated in that regard
several minisystems also are known prior not included ATM
Most are considered microbial or harmless to Biome
Regulations must be adhered to involving residential usage
All immersions are suggested with protective gear:Disclaimer
All bioforms etc occurent habitats are catalogued and monitored
Conveyed or Operational Relm-Flora/Fauna
Gamete Zygote usage may vary over expanse

small terms trophy base (just for play) not work
may or may not be adjusted for sequence coordinations
(launchers can also deploy range targets)
aram conditioner
so im thinking about making the shards aram spire too
this aram can then have decklines and recline conduits-topsides
so they will be axued and quad supported with full cane systems too
and essentially be range finder to terroritory controlusing quasi shield for aether crystalizing or aether prismatics
the quad atop will be like the aforemention quadbase
of quasiaether/chainwork/scriptwyrding(wqizlocks/ and a lockstop-canister or a mix of those
having to xproc busline that are for multifuncs being on x24 pathing of 3/4 of the enitrity
so xproc has to abstract itself with the busline too for the proxy base to perform maximally
with the 1/4 being the abstraction unless there is some other way i dont know exactly other
so pre-stract abstract and shoelace and then restring it all for xproc for multifuncs
system turns shards into crysalis and arams are conveyed as same or conjuncted to tower
so shard expanse is simply a full fortress with internal or external aram
so their hilt bases can be engines to themselves
wher a xproc aram/fortress is an engine via the non xproc aram/fortress
each with internalized or externalized components of their build-sets
reach x2 per if also then 4x for the first set and 4x the secondset make 8x total sets
with 8 conduit secure the world base basically
can also be stopped pegged or proxies each in between each of itselves
and prime sequenced via primestations that are also semi-pegged itnernally or externally
so 8x x4 or with full internal or externalized some multiple thereof 64 or 128
or if semi-quartered at least 86x can occur
that requires pitquartering and half stepping and inversive-double sequences in alternation
with semi-seq of course for the previous mentioned low reg med hi (special) seq chains
this helps with isomer sectioning and short-seq which requires isomer sectioning
and users gloss to help conceal proxy base hubs
is a oem proxy hub so it doesnt matter as much but they project data fields in quasi-boxes
the quasi-box is basically what makes the environmental template (which then can be used)
controlled environmental template protects the system to immerse itself within without going 32x
basically if counted all the stringings a 5 layer pound cake
--
so it basically makes the super spaghetti train and then the train goes with it like a server
so the multifunc gets abstracted with the proxy and the original abstracts and also the center
that is connected to a header that connects to the xproc but its complicated and the xproc
but it can be used on the abstracted relay because everything is braided and restrung
so the multicalcCOMPcoreIsRooted. The proxy is rooted. The abstractionLine is Rooted. FuncTionTable is tsectioned inthe relay
then the 4 original abstractions that work now are being xproced with new headers
so the header for the 1stMajors, the 2ndMajors, the 3Minor, and the 4thsystem-----and the NOW NOX-encodes can be attempted with prior complex ABSworks-profiles too
are used all on a proxy header---NOX testing with proxy-encodes too
----
and then the proxy header is connected to a new box header
where the newbox headers is split in to braids and simplified for each table
then the original table is set, the proxy table is set, and the newbox table is set
then a centerpiece table is used to connect those together all to a header and the header
is filled in with a newbox(freeagent) abstraction blockchain
--
so it looks like Header1-->Header2(allofit)--Header3AbstractionNewBox-->Header4Connected
but header three requires a free agent newboxing lattice
which basically stands for the xproc once its connected (that isnt connected yet)
once its connected the 4th header is cleaned for the whole of the xproc
then the xproc will be set as open socket or onto the xproc socket above the original proc
and it utilizes a conveyed network to do that so it must be balanced recalibrated later
---
basically turns the whole system into supersystem that doesnt need anything cuz automated
all i would do is throw down a level and expect the super system to work from anywhere lol
so if i deploy a t-base or a template for a t-base it could work with a level or command
and i could interpase my switchboard to a file on the system to run as neccessary
--
as a remote operative T-Station
this would interface with conduits without having to go through security of course for admin
using a meta-rail for t-sections i can translate full switches of templated data
using REMOTE command
via a personalized console of PDA----alot like SSH to be honest but THROUGH A PROXY-POINT that is also (not vulnerable and has its security)
---
97% system load (not just mem)
then i can vortexualize the nexus via the integration usages and interfolding/polating/grating
using a y1-->y2 conversion issues of an independent origin
it will form a rudimentary quantum origin
---
idk but maybe
a systemic hotspot basically
by consolidated or preprogrammed badend zones
or a cracklebox
which can occur with arams i suppose
and a solf-base
it will base its wiregrid on the structure or template for the infrastructure without real label
or a false label or semi-true label or something that isnt there because its a WIParea
it will be able to adjust an imprinted image without having mounted the image on the space
due to quo-zoning it would use to make the routing space for the framework to send xfer on
it would forge a temporary relay via a template or a virtual-compartment of encased shelving
house data and xfer data in a virtual space for realmtime usage of that in a quotient-packet
also known as tethering data but in this case t-sectionedd quotients that use for specmapping
idk i think its really stupid bit it uses tethering and data-snares
===
the nexus gets voodoo/chickenbonemeal/scraphaulbarreledwaset/colorsequinedlocked
basically the nexus get pit quartered
(this almost didnt happened but l&s codes may apply too)
this prevents an incredible dual based gloss
or regulates it well enough
that s2c and c2s are not at high counts
if on meta logs
meta logs will be used to handle packet data on nexus via old -cable ampule counters
 necessary
to sustain circuit campability/capability
this creates a true stalk root or double/t-root
blume/blossom and budding or spur base effects function smoothly at this level operation
but is highly propylactic
and can reduce back to large load and long seq builds if overstacked
if left undisrupted can cause lotus calc-base
for full meta compensation
or somewhat alot of compensation
known as petal-programming
this allows for fair-share connectivity via pda once again and can be inter-comms-patched
so commandlines can be biometric and vocalizer can be detected
using gloss to condition a pulse-signet also in capture
and be prioritized on monitor or active render to set for balance or turbulence measurements
with stalk systems in lotus it can be stabilized as a field wave
and the algoritmic intellence can utilize or comparitively analyse it for resource data
resource data is highly instanced as either functionable or sustainble data or environmental
this can assist with noise suppresion and or cancellation of background vibration
for residual comparison it can assist in disembodied proxy maintenence
this creates a visible lotus stem (blume) that can be equated to aloof data flak stendal
which is used in ITsec as well as wasp netlle usage potential can be tracable to other hives
--
such as ababel or spire hive
as in regular hives, babel, spire and also conduit hives
translates to environmetal-->cluster-->nether--->technical
can form a protective webbing for a quad-based or some sort of quartered nexus
for use of binureal -or lattice-sectioning
which creates a full chakra system network that is under conditional domain
and can help to authenticate most in a eregulatory keypasee which is temporarily generated
so a metalockable-logset can occur in sequence of nexus request and xfer to accordingly
then minor and major systems can correalate sparingly as characterized
this will cause a quad-or quasi encoding press-tableture to mark the event as its phased in
and with proxy-boxing virtually tapping from 8chakrabase-t4tableture-to ourRelmtemplate
will count itself agent to realm usage at standard cost and re-aparate accordingly to norms
essentially it will perform a full system install of its entire manifolds
and perform quasi print capable actions
if parameters are correct
it will virtually analgraphy itself into position as well as a positional use to the realm base
either conveyed and fully rendered as templated
this can also be backtracked or as needed for developmental purpose
seamless at preference or qualities with minimal imposters
this can help with l&s conversions and inversion and reversion
--
i guess with the analgraphy
that would just be a tiny cube that is mostly everything at raw resource (so a resource box)
resource boxes can be t-sections and templated out to include or exclude raw resources
and they can be reappropriated like as the lotus would compensate for their meta-states
sort of like a omni-use cube----maybe NOXhives too(noxscones)
that would single out its most viable formatting
or a confirming template to the environment-demands or workorder/calculation request
and it would reassemble full builds accordingly to most efficient or most prioritized
and or hash its reported processes as it having performed its tasks
so when you want a ship it makes ones and you want it to be stronger better faster with guns
it makes that too and then you just get what you generally would expect
this helps also with archived byte sampling to provide most accurate renditions
can also be used as a world setter as per region it can fill most requirements
either via passive authentications or direct guided persepctives
the rest of its conditioning being left to encoding and artificializing its manfacture via status
this may or may not include a metaplex checklist for authetication of context or contents
this will form a posilock-meta-table if possible it can be administered or appropriated via lists
using meta-scripts to adjust for the meta-table it can adjust customizations of objects
like a texture pack would adjust but it could be t-sectioned for other macros
using a tool assisted programming meta-locking it can fit necessary tags by account reqs
so its more of a meta-board for stylized renditions
via account usages or preferences
---
and for a repository of informational esentials (or IT-quintessence)
it-base quintessences used for proliferation of requested contexts and schematic products
so you can sort of build what you want and have it build what you want to your ideal settings
so basically an AI building device
i wanted to use this space for super aux construction in automation but now its for nexus
the nexus posilocked module will be an adjustable meta-locker for repurposed data housings
i suppose a cab or archiving shelf realm like the akashic shelves geared towards this type is ---LOL--(akashic is at the NOX-meta's in our APPLIED-countersurface tampers atm--haven't purified them at all to even use -we are trying to) 
this would basically be the stamp and seal of the collared signet as it were in stencilgraphics -(also stereographics-this with stenciles may help to assign a "FILTER to help purge akashic records of nox)maybe making them barely of use
otherwise i would have just edified the shielding with a compulsary assymetrical bean-basket
--
quitesentially used for contiguity purposes
like all of it
in a cracklebox basically


*****at the launch
then this shit goes balls to walls on stock and farm/ the zoo not the farm
they can use in theory and adaptive header system with a relay to a motalocking for artifacts
such as i would use for spyragraphic helix or and lotus spyrographs
which can repropogate as quantum artifacts for later use (particularly island usage)
this can help to propogate a personalized quasi strain
for quasi threading
for prim usage and prim transmission as to control the domain objectives more efficiently
through an encirchment processing of various meta states otherwise not in mixture or setting
