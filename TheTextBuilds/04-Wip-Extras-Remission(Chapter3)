after that XZ exploit similarity i wanted to point out almost as if a popularity grab...but damn its just almost too...similar. Just like...way too similar. Both in the timeframe it all happened and from then and now...just how things suddenly got fixed when i found a fix for it in my own code too...just....things that make me go hmm (this happens so much)---im just glad i have feelings as a empathetic being and am generally not a bad person. You can tell because I am being transparent in my work too
moving on:its my cakeday.
34k more slides and i feel like i have an anuerysm. (no i really feel like my brain is being grinded down into nothing)---infact i cant barely work without feeling absolutely demoralized. this staright up sucks (tbh I HATE IT)--i can't stress that enough. I could finish line after line. I can zoom through this, but no, I AM constantly being assaulted by harassment and all kinds of stuff (am i actually ever going to finish this? IM STRAIGHT UP NOT HAVING A GOOD TIME THATS FOR SURE)---infact I am not going to until something gives. Period. I am sick of sitting in front of the screen accomplishing nothing. Fuck this for now. For real.


rite now it feeels like its gonna be okay (except not right now when im rewriting this it feels like its absolutely desert-dry-and-sand-caked awful)
it feels that way because i said i needed 5 systems with shoelaces and all the wirings
so it can fit as 1 system technically with the marks written out for 1 2 3 4 5
