I am finally done I think with this and I am just going to review 70k odd screenshots to get the EXTRAS completed
I may end up scanning some old notebooks full of garbage I will be able to pick out if I want to add anything else in too as a super-extras optional package I will try to code up. (By which I mean use ai-10x or something to do it for me.)
I feel like its something like a personal-millenium-falcon so to speak (of coding devices)
