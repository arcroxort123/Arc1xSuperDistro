This starts off as an idea for a whip (wave)
In which 24 paneled segments (seemingly 6 or so segments per panel
Are linked together on a wavelength and transfer data/energy over a wave.
Which informs its endpoint as to the energy/data transfer exchanged over whatsoever transfix wavelength.
The wavelength is monitored of each segment in the overall parse of data transfered in its wavelength per transfix
---
This is later developed into a ballixtically conjoined paneled-whip with or without segments and or condtions upon their conjuctions between segments (ballistix pivots)--this may or may not make any difference because I am not a scientist
But this idea occured to me in a dream to put forward
So the idea is that there is a quantum-inference of data upon the transfix of a wavelength through this whip, and how it is transferred relies on the ability to perform the wavelength of whatsoever transferred through the shape of the whip, reaching an endpoint in which the signal registers, at some quantum level
That also a standard ring may be made in which to induce the wavelength as a coil, or feedback portal, whether segmented or ballisxtically conjoined, over a "spherical or round-circular" coil of that being in flux to certain transfixations of the whip in transfer of its wavelength, filters and or incubates a feedback unto itself at its connected endpoints, or sections, having achieved a full cycle.
If this occurs in a broken/mitigated amount of sectioning off its segments/conjunctions over any parses or a wind up of its circuit that may be done so, and testing can be done so, but I attribute this to the same details as a "Stargate/SuperCollider model" in which the ballistic transfer of data/energy over a wavelength is referred to as Vortex-Source-Portaling.
This may be performed or sustained mechanically over various builds/models in which either a circular/porticulus has been secured as a gateway, or otherwise, a length of rope variable to a number of segments and or conjunctions of ballistix/pivots of those segments, for which I think will require some design in which to achieve a certain model/version acceptable of inducing the quantum-transfer of data.
I think there is some specification to be made here through experimentation. But I don't have the actual research, and the idea is not particularly mine or original as I have seen this expressed in other circumstances, this is also something that had been more pronounced to me in a dream. It was a weird dream that was personal to me in a way, but it was not the first time I had it either and also I just am picking up on the idea of using a whip in that dream as a "show tool" for entertainment purposes humoring the idea that there is some scientific purpose behind using one this way.

Anyways of course I am going to bring the entire system on board to this "hypothesis" for which I want to incorporate with DATA/Energy being transferred through a multiple of pathways/channels in which they are programmed such to being a massive phyisical-representation of the system under the effect of a super collider and expressing its data on a quantum measure in this way...somehow. Like a massive intranet (contiguity).
Anyways that is just a side goal of the over all project, but this does not occur until the finalized stages in which I may then have a purpose to bring it in as a Dragon-Roam-Coilhead or something very nifty.
